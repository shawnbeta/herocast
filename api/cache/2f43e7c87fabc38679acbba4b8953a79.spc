<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/26/periscope/?ncid=rss_truncated">Twitter’s Periscope app launched today adding another mobile livestreaming app to the mix alongside Meerkat</a> and others. Like Meerkat, Periscope lets you stream video live right from your phone and see chatting from viewers. Unlike Meerkat, the chatting is in app, not on Twitter, you can tap the screen to send hearts AND the biggest difference, Periscope archives videos for viewers to watch later. Periscope also lets you choose to tweet a link or not, and even invite selected people to private broadcasts.</p>

Instead, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/25/nasa-asteroid-redirect-mission/">NASA decided that the ARM robotic spacecraft will take a boulder from an asteroid&#8217;s surface, then put it into orbit around the moon</a>, where it can be studied and sampled. The Asteroid Redirect Mission is scheduled to launch in 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Pick of the day:</strong></p>
<p>Hi Tom and DTNS Crew , I&#8217;m $1 worth of a boss and I thought of a pick on the way home in grey and windy London (see pic attached) for you to let everyone know about. Of course everyone knows about Amazon Prime and how good its 2 day US and next day UK delivery, and instant video etc, but did you know you can share the prime delivery perks with your family members who live at the same address for free? Just go in to your prime account management and invite family members and its done and they get the free 2 day/next day delivery.</p>
<p>Keep on keeping on</p>

<p>Tom (I’m assuming all of these points will be in the discussion section today, but my two cents),</p>
<p>&#8230;I find myself much more compelled to use Meerkat. I’ve been coming around to the ephemeral nature of Snapchat for a while now, and I like the fact that with Meerkat, I can create a live stream of doing something silly to make a few of my friends laugh, but then I don’t have to worry about it following me around on social media down the line. Its temporally limited nature feels like it allows for more “authenticity” at the expense of production quality&#8212; Maybe Meerkat vs Periscope will become like Snapchat vs Instagram, their focus is completely different even though there are some surface similarities, and we’re only comparing them now because they both run on top of Twitter (arguably to Meerkat’s detriment now). Or Meerkat will be the next Chat Roulette and be dead in a month.</p>
<p>Also, by being able to save streams, isn’t Twitter opening itself up to a world of hurt (or at least inconvenience) with copyright issues?</p>

This allows developers to integrate Messenger into their apps. For example you can go from Messenger to the Giphy app to find that perfect animated GIF then back to messenger to send it to a friend. Or jump to the ESPN app to grab a story and send the link to a friend. Facebook is also trying out business communication over Messenger with Everlane and Zulily. Customers can talk to customer support and get order updates through messenger.</p>

<p><strong>News From You</strong></p>
<p><strong>djsekani</strong> submitted the Verge article that <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/24/8285319/radioshack-selling-customer-information-bankruptcy">Radio Shack put its database of 13 million customer email and 65 million physical addresses up for auction as part of its bankruptcy proceedings</a>. Dominant shareholder Standard General won the bid but the court must approve. Attorneys general from Texas and Tennessee have challenged the purchase on the basis that Radio Shack’s privacy policy says it will not sell customer information. AT&amp;T also claims it is the rightful owner of some of the data. The US FTC has previously allowed data like this to be sold in bankruptcy cases as long as the privacy policy is maintained and the buyer is in the same general line of business.</p>
<p><strong>habichuelacondulce</strong> sent us the Verge story about <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/24/8283565/amazon-prime-air-delivery-drone-faa-regulations">Amazon’s testifying before a Senate subcommittee that the drone approved by the FAA is already obsolete</a>. The FAA took a year and a half to process Amazon’s application to fly one specific model of drone. Amazon’s VP of global policy Paul Misener claimes the European Aviation Safety Agency, which treats drones as a new category of aircraft has a dramatically shorter approval time. Amazon also argued for automated flight to be allowed not just line of sight. Misener warned that drone innovation would suffer and development could move overseas to take advantage of less restrictive legislation.</p>

<p><strong>Pick of the Day:  <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a></strong></p>
<p>Hi Tom &amp; Jennie</p>
<p>On Friday’s show the listener’s pick was learn Python the Hard Way. This got me thinking about a pick that I’ve been meaning to send in for a while.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> is a plain text editor with loads of useful features. In fact I’ve used it for several years as a web developer as my main editor. I even wrote my university dissertation using it! There’s also lots of plugins for it to assist with editing all sorts of languages or just plain text files.</p>
<p>Both major versions are free to use with a “unlimited trial”, which basically means every 15th time or so you press save you’ll have to close a popup window. Which sounds annoying but if you’re just editing the occasional file I think its totally fine.</p>
<p>So if you’re ever in need of a lightweight, easy to use text editor which is supported on all desktop platforms, Sublime Text is my go-to recommendation.</p>
<p>Keep up the good work,</p>
<p>Ali Smith a.k.a fortythieves in chat</p>
<p>P.S. [Feel free to ignore this during the show] I’ve been a bit slack on this myself, but I just wanted to put out a quick reminder that bestofbot is still a thing and archiving the best bits of DTNS <img src="http://www.dailytechnewsshow.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p><strong>Message of the Day</strong></p>
<p>It seems lately you or guests have made a mention to divx when talking about something that has failed. On episode #2453 JuRY mentioned it after talking about the DRM on LED. This was the last straw. There is no way you could be talking about DivX (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DivX) the video codec because its a codec. It either is used or not but fail is kind of a strong word for a media wrapper.</p>
<p>So I did a search of the tubes in the event there was another meaning and sure enough Wikipedia has the answer. DIVX (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIVX) was a Circuit City video rental service. I have no knowledge of this and I think I would have been their target audience.</p>
<p>Thank you for the great shows!</p>
<p>-Jim</p>
<p>======</p>
<p>Just wanted to let you and your audience know that the docket and some of the pleadings in the RadioShack BK case (case# 15-10197, Delaware), are available via the RECAP project on archive.org if they care to peruse (otherwise Pacer access cost $0.10 PER PAGE). While a Chapter 11 case is a morass of legalese and somewhat arcane procedures, it may be of some interest, if for nothing else then getting a glimpse at the inner workings and relationships of a large corporation. For a more readable version, your listeners can also checkout https://cases.primeclerk.com/radioshack , which does a better job of presenting the same info.</p>

<p><strong>Headlines</strong></p>
<p>The New York Times reports that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/24/business/media/facebook-may-host-news-sites-content.html">the New York Times may be among media sites in talks with Facebook to host content within the Facebook site</a>. The New York Times would not comment to itself on the matter. According to several of the people briefed on the talks, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were bound by nondisclosure agreements, he idea would be to improve the load time of links to news pages by not sending people away from Facebook. News sites would possibly sell ads on the pages. National Geographic and BuzzFeed are also allegedly considering the partnership.</p>
<p><span id="more-3272"></span></p>
<p>Business Insider passes on a report from AdWeek’s Sam Thielman that <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/google-fiber-real-measurement-of-tv-ad-views-2015-3">Google will soon test a system to target and track TV ads on Google Fiber in Kansas City</a>.  Sponsors could deliver ads in real time and match the ad to geography, type of program or viewing history.<br />
Viewers would have to opt out of having their viewing history used for targeting. &#8212; Also <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/24/google-fiber-in-salt-lake-city/">Google Fiber is coming to Salt Lake City which will make our friend Scott Johnson happy I think.</a></p>
<p>Tom’s Hardware reports <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/news/logitech-announces-mx-master-mouse,28813.html">Logitech has replaced the venerable Peformance Mouse MX with the MX Master</a>. The MX master is slightly larger and lighter than its predecessor, sports 5 buttons vs the original’s 9 but adds a gesture button, and features a thumb wheel on the left side. The mouse comes with a USB dongle but also supports bluetooth for up to 3 devices. MX Master uses Logitech’s Darkfield Laser Sensor for use on glassy surfaces and adjustable DPI setting from 400 to 1600 DPI in 200 DPI increments. The MX Master will release in April for $99.</p>
<p>CNET reports that<a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/amazon-fire-tv-stick-stakes-out-uk-adds-hotel-friendly-wi-fi-sign-in/"> a software update for Amazon&#8217;s Fire TV and Fire TV stick— will make it easy to sign in to things like hotel WiFi that usually require a browser</a>.  The update also adds support for USB connected storage, compatibility with Bluetooth headphones, as well as shortcuts to sleep, display mirroring and prime music playlists. The update will roll out over the next few weeks in all countries where the stick is available.</p>
<p>The Verge reports Kyle Pflug, Microsoft’s Project Spartan program manager wrote on the IE Blog that<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/24/8284781/internet-explorer-is-slowly-dying"> the new browser Project Spartan will be the exclusive engine on Windows 10.</a> “Internet Explorer 11 will remain fundamentally unchanged from Windows 8.1, continuing to host the legacy engine exclusively.” So long IE.</p>
<p><strong>News From You</strong></p>
<p><strong>ccastro425</strong> and <strong>Johnsie776</strong> both noted stories on <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/23/8280497/net-neutrality-lawsuit-ustelecom-alamo-broadband-fcc">the first two lawsuits against the US FCC’s Open Internet Orde</a>r. The Verge reports industry group USTelecom filed suit in Washington DC challenging the Title II classification as not “legally sustainable.” US Telecom does not have issue with the rules themselves, just the legal basis for them. Texas ISP Alamo Broadband filed suit in New Orleans claiming the new rules cause the business harm. The FCC believes the suits will be dismissed. The new rules have been made public but have not been published by the Federal Register and will not go into effect until 60 days after that publication.</p>
<p><strong>starfuryzeta</strong> sent us the IT World report that <a href="http://www.itworld.com/article/2900695/microsoft-to-support-8k-video-resolutions-with-windows-10.html">Microsoft will have 8k video compatability in Windows 10 for displays larger than 27 inches</a>.  Windows 10 will also support 4K resolutions on PCs with screen sizes of 8 inches or higher, and on small-screen tablets and smartphones with screen sizes of 6 inches and higher.  The OS will support 4K video codec HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding, aka H.265).</p>
<p><strong>the_corley</strong> posted the Ars Technica report that <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/03/us-judge-orders-seizure-of-foreign-domains-owned-by-chinese-company/">a US District Court Judge Vernon Broderick has ruled against China’s Fentago software</a>, ordering its domain names be seized, social media accounts blocked and payment processes cut off. Decryption licensing body AACS brought legal action over the sale of DVD ripping software. Fentago claimed it had stopped selling the software in the US and the court had no jurisdiction elsewhere. The Judge noted the tools are still available in the US and Fentago’s explanations as to why were not credible. It is doubtful whether registries in Japan, Germany and China will obey the order.</p>
<p><strong>KAPT_Kipper</strong> noted the Verge story about <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/23/8280193/twitch-hack-password-change">Twitch’s decision to reset user passwords, stream keys and YouTube and Twitter connections after the discovery of unauthorized access to some user account information</a>. In an email to affected users Twitch wrote the compromised information possibly included username, email address, password (which was cryptographically protected), the last IP address you logged in from, and first and last name, phone number, address, and date of birth.</p>
<p><strong>doorsrio</strong> sent us the story from NDTV that <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/freedom-of-speech-online-section-66-a-is-struck-down-by-supreme-court-749104">India’s Supreme Court struck down Section 66(A) of the Information Technology Act finding it vague and unconstitutional</a>. Section 66(A) read: &#8220;Any person who sends by any means of a computer resource any information that is grossly offensive or has a menacing character; or any information which he knows to be false, but for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience, danger, obstruction, insult shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and with fine.&#8221; Section 66(A) is part of the larger Section 66 in the IT Act which deals with computer related offenses. It was amended to the IT Act in 2008.</p>

<p>Pick of the Day: <a href="https://triplogmileage.com/">Trip Log Mileage</a> via Mark Wonsil</p>
<p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>In these taxing times, citizens of many countries might have to keep track of their mileage and there&#8217;s a pretty slick app available on iOS and Android that helps one track automobile expenses either by mileage (with gps) or actual expenses. It&#8217;s called TripLog. The results can be sync&#8217;d to the cloud and it produces some nice reports for your accountant.</p>
<p><a href="https://triplogmileage.com/">https://triplogmileage.com/</a></p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>Message of the Day</strong></p>
<p>Hey DTNS folks,</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been listening to Tom break down tech news for right around 8 years now. I think this is the first time I&#8217;ve written in.</p>
<p>I think varying the visual makeup of security warnings is a horrible idea. Yes, people take them less seriously when they see them a lot, but I have encountered several successful phishing scams that used pop-ups disguised as security warnings. If people can be fooled by these when they look passably similar to their existing warnings what is the click-through rate going to be when they don&#8217;t know what an actual warning should look like? I just think sometimes complacency is an acceptable risk.</p>
<p>Love the show,</p>

<p>Google Glass? Not so dead. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/23/8276661/google-glass-not-dead-yet-eric-schmidt" target="_blank"><strong>The Verge</strong> passes along Google executive Chairman Eric Scmidt’s comments to the Wall Street Journal</a>. Schmidt said &#8220;We ended the Explorer program and the press conflated this into us canceling the whole project, which isn’t true.” He said that’s why they gave it to Nest’s Tony FAdell so it could become user-friendly. He also said Glass is a long term project and that &#8220;[It&#8217;s] like saying the self-driving car is a disappointment because it’s not driving me around now.”</p>

<p><strong>TechCrunch</strong> reports on <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/23/instagram-layout/#TQUNqg:rYNV" target="_blank">the launch of a new standalone app from Instagram called Layout</a>. It’s a collage app that lets you take up to 9 photos and arrange them and apply filters. It can do things like pick out just the photos with faces, take a series of photos and instantly make a collage from them, and general speeds up creation. Finished collages can be saved to the device, shared to Facebook and Instagram or sent through the OS’s sharing options to other apps. Layout from Instagram is free and available for iOS now and coming to Android within months.</p>

<p>Nintendo president <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/23/8278933/nintendo-denies-zelda-netflix-series" target="_blank">Satoru Iwata told <strong>Time Magazine</strong> that the Wall Street Journal&#8217;s story reporting a Zelda show being developed for Netflix was &#8220;not based on correct information.&#8221;</a> So you&#8217;re saying there&#8217;s a chance!

<p><strong>News From You:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Starfuryzeta</strong> sent us the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/23/packing-peanuts-in-lithium-batteries/" target="_blank">Engadget report that packing peanuts &#8212; you know the things in your hair, on the floor, and stuck to the cat &#8212; may be the key to a new generation of lithium-ion batteries</a>. Purdue University researchers developed a process that heats the peanuts and turns them into carbon sheets or carbon nanoparticles that can be used as anodes where lithium ions are stored during charging. Early test samples last for 300 charging cycles without losing capacity. They need to get that number higher but unlike most battery advances this one is already practical, cheap and easy to implement.</p>
<p><strong>Doorsrio</strong> sent us this <a href="http://thenextweb.com/shareables/2015/03/23/boeing-patents-a-force-field-system-to-protect-military-vehicles-from-explosions/" target="_blank">The Next Web story about Boeing receiving a patent for a force field system</a>. PatentYogi, a patent service company created a short video explaining the patent. The patent specifically covers a system to attenuate shockwave blast energy traveling through the air from affecting an object. Sensors detect the initial blast and direction and then use lasers to ionize the air between the object and the blast creating a plasma channel or a bubble of super heated air. This causes the blast waves to be redirected, reflected or absorb by the plasma channel.</p>
<p><strong>Dmmacs</strong> passed along the news that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/23/fitbit-wearers-can-now-use-multiple-devices/" target="_blank">a software update later this week will allow Fitbit wearers to use multiple devices on the same account</a>. Good news for Fitbit who would like to sell more devices to the same consumers, and good news for users who want to swap between the fitness-centric Fitbit surge and the lightweight Fitbit Flex. The update will also add features for tracking bike rides.</p>
<p><strong>Metalfreak</strong> submitted the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/03/mris-show-our-brains-shutting-down-when-we-see-security-prompts/" target="_blank">Ars Technica article that shows multiple security warnings bore you</a>. Researchers will present a paper to that effect next month at the Association for Computing Machinery&#8217;s CHI 2015 conference. MRI images show a &#8220;precipitous drop&#8221; in visual processing after even one repeated exposure to a standard security warning and a &#8220;large overall drop&#8221; after 13 of them. The researcher team—made up of six scientists from Brigham Young University, the University of Pittsburgh, and Google propose polymorphic warnings that change their colors, text, shapes, and other characteristics, to combat the habituation.</p>

<p><strong>Pick of the day:  <a href="http://michaelgeist.ca" target="_blank">michaelgeist.ca</a></strong></p>
<p>From defrosting Ottawa, Canada&#8230;</p>
<p>I have a pick for fellow Canadians who maybe have heard many stories about the FCC&#8217;s Title II adventures but are looking for a more local perspective. Michael Geist, at michaelgeist.ca, is a Professor of Law at the University of Ottawa who writes regularly about the CRTC (the best equivalent to the FCC in Canada), privacy, media issues, digital rights and more. I have been a subscriber to his RSS feed for years and his articles are always insightful and timely. In my opinion, Michael Geist is the pre-eminent Canadian voice on technology and policy issues in the 21st century.</p>

<p><strong>Messages</strong></p>
<p>In response to Friday’s show where HBO, Showtime, and others want to put servers into an ISP’s Data Center… As a person who has done such a task with third-party payment gateways on major card providers networks and third-party servicers on major banking networks, it is very cost-prohibited. To do this, you would have to set up a termination point for the main-feed to connect to a lease-line that terminates at the data center in question. The trunk of the lease-line at the data center will still need to be connected into a dedicated switch within the data center. The servers will have to connect up to the switch. This all will have to be done twice (primary/backup or hot/hot fail over or some type of forced fail over load-balancing). Say all this was accomplished then you have server support, patching, emergency access, upgrade cycles and more.</p>
<p>There is a lot more detail that I could bore you with, but you get the idea. Putting a server into another company’s data cent<br />
er is glossed over as an easy-inexpensive task. If it was, then all the bank’s and financial institutions I’ve worked for must have been doing something wrong.<br />
Akamai, F5, and the like, have a business-model that capitalizes on the connectivity complexities and costs. It will be cheaper, more efficient to use them than do it yourself. Most tier 3 and tier 4 data centers already have access to these services built in.</p>
<p>BTW, if they do want to do this, I&#8217;m always looking for work <img src="http://www.dailytechnewsshow.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> !</p>
<p>Love the show!</p>

<p><strong>The_corley</strong> sent us this Engadget story reporting <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/19/project-loon-chile-australia-test/">the success of a Google ballon delivering an internet connection from Chile to Australia</a>. Part of Google’s Project Loon the balloon was launched from New Zealand and across the Pacific to Chile, 5500 miles away. After testing the ballon’s command functions and airborne LTE network they sent it back across the Pacific to Australia and tested internet connectivity achieving two hours of connectivity in places where it might not occur otherwise. The tests are giving Google a better picture of how the system will scale.</p>
<p><strong>Berke80</strong> submitted <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150317/08091030343/drm-how-to-make-30000-hour-led-bulbs.shtml">the TechDirt story highlighting The IlluMask. </a>Let’s assume you find a light therapy mask covered in LEDs a desirable product. You’d normally have to pay hundreds of dollars for one. The IllumiMask is only $30. How could this have been done? By breaking it. Even though LEDs should last 30-40,000 hours, IllumiMask programs in a restriction that only lets you use the mask 30 times for 15 minutes each time before you have to throw it away and buy another. However as TechDirt explains, a screwdriver, a paperclip and some gentle hands can reset the IllumimAsk’s use count letting you use it for the life of the bulbs.</p>

<p>Tom and Jennie,</p>
<p>I know most people in your audience know about Gazelle as a place to go to sell used electronics, but I recently discovered they are an excellent place to buy them as well. They list their items on their eBay storefront, and list their condition from “poor” to “very good” and give clear explanations of what each category means. Their prices are really competitive and you don’t have fight other people’s bids since its all “buy now”. Their free shipping is also excellent, I recently bought an iPad mini 2 32gb, it arrived at my door within 30 hours of ordering. The only downside is the inventory fluctuates fairly quickly, so if you see a deal you should probably jump on it. They are also my go to recommendation for replacement phones out of contact, thought your audience should know.</p>

<p>Hey, guys. I&#8217;m a little behind on shows, but I wanted to suggest Dropbox as another legitimate use of peer-to-peer file sharing. The &#8220;LAN Sync&#8221; option will sync your files across computers on your network without each peer having to go through Dropbox&#8217;s servers. When setting up a new computer, the first thing I do is install Dropbox and enable LAN Sync which significantly reduces the synchronization process. (If doing so on Windows, you have to explicitly give permission for the firewall to allow traffic on that port.)<br />
Best,<br />

<p>TechCrunch reports <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/17/windows-10-summer/?ncid=rss" target="_blank">Microsoft’s Executive VP of Operating Systems told the audience at WinHEC in Shenzen, China that Windows 10 will launch this summer in 190 countries and 111 languages</a>. HE also said Windows 10 will be a free upgrade fro all Windows 7 users regardless of whether the user can prove their copy is legitimate or not. Kind of an amnesty program for Windows pirates tech. AND Microsoft will give select Xiaomi Mi 4 users the chance to test Windows 10 on their phones. Yes their android-based MI phones.</p>

<p>CNET reports on the launch of <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/sony-launches-playstation-vue-as-bigger-pricier-internet-tv/" target="_blank">Sony’s Play Station Vue Internet TV service in New York, Chicago and Philadelphia today, starting at $50 a month after a 7 day free trial</a>. Subscribers can watch 60 channels from CBS, NBCm Fox, Discovery, Scripps, Turner and Viacom, with AMC coming soon. $10 extra adds regional sports channels and another $10 adds 26 various other channels. The service provides 3 day on demand access to many shows programming and allows a cloud DVR to store recordings for up to 28 days. Streams can be viewed on the PS3 and PS4. Support for iPads and other devices is coming soon.</p>
<p>Tim Cook talked with <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3042435/steves-legacy-tim-looks-ahead" target="_blank">Fast company in a wide ranging interview that touched on Steve Jobs legacy and comparisons of Apple with Microsoft</a>. Cook said he thinks Apple is more willing than Microsoft to walk away from legacy technology that holds it back. He also unsurprisingly said the Apple Watch will be the first smartwatch that matters. Doubtless that is true. To Tim Cook.</p>
<p>Engadget has a story on <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/18/htc-uh-oh-free-m9-replacement/?ncid=rss_truncated" target="_blank">HTC’s new “Uh Oh Protection” program that will replace your broken “One M9” smart phone once for free</a>. HTC will replace your phone for free within the 1st year of ownership if you break the screen, damage the phone, or move carriers. If you happen to take care of the phone for the 1st year you’ll be rewarded with a $100 discount on the purchase of a new One phone in the future.</p>
<p>The Verge reports <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/17/8235277/sxsw-astro-teller-google-x" target="_blank">Google X’s Astro Teller spoke at SXSW telling the audience that Google’s research lab</a> is opening up about their projects more often and earlier. He mentioned that the Google Glass Explorer program was an attempt to do this but it was marketed too much and too often implied it was a finished project. He also talked about how baloons for Project Loon were built to fail fast so they wouldn’t accidentally drift into illegal airspace, stories about self-driving cars avoiding ducks, and how the team was disappointed when a drone delivery prototype didn’t crash in windy conditions.</p>
<p>CNET reports that a <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/uber-struck-down-in-germany-but-its-not-as-bad-as-it-sounds/" target="_blank">German court in Frankfurt has given a preliminary ruling that could ban UberPop</a>. This means UberPop’s carpooling service would not be allowed to run in Germany and could face a fine of 250,000 Euros ($266,000). The case against UberPop was brought to court by Taxi Deutschland which argued that UberPop is illegal because drivers do not have to have the proper licenses to drive people around. Since the ruling is preliminary UberPop can still operate until a final verdict is rendered in 3 to 4 weeks. Uber Taxi and Uber Black services in Germany are unaffected.</p>

<p><strong>Pick of the day:</strong> <a href="http://www.rifftrax.com/" target="_blank">RiffTrax</a></p>
<p>My pick is something a little different, RiffTrax!</p>
<p>If you are unfamiliar, rifftrax.com features some of the cast of Mystery Science Theater. The group records funny commentary tracks for major films, B-Movies and shorts.</p>
<p>Commentaries for major films are offered as .MP3 Downloads that you’ll then need to sync up with a copy of the film yourself. But if that sounds like too much work, they also offer a great selection of smaller films that you can download pre-synced and DRM free!</p>
<p>Some of my personal favorites are Viva Knievel, The Guy From Harlem, Kingdom of the Spiders (Staring William Shatner!) and Cool as Ice!</p>
<p>Check them out!</p>

<p>Warren Owen writes us with an idea.</p>
<p>Nintendo has dropped quarter after quarter, year after year, for half a decade. With roughly $6B in sales, yet only $29M in profit, Nintendo has a market cap of $16.8B.</p>
<p>Maybe now is the time. Time for what? Well What if another company just came in and bought Nintendo. Say a company with $173B in sales, $37B in profit, and $8.5B CASH ON HAND. What would happen to the &#8220;great mobile wars&#8221; if Apple bought Nintendo, and had everyones favorite characters only available on iOS? What if you could play these games, and then &#8220;AirPlay&#8221; them to your HDTV through your AppleTV (voiceover &#8211; now featuring HBO Now). What would that look like in every home across the planet? And, keep DeNA in the mix, to continue the development of new games with our old favorite heroes.<br />
This would seem to be the perfect move for Apple.</p>
<p>Sorry this was long and dramatic. <img src="http://www.dailytechnewsshow.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley" /><br />

<p>It’s that time again. Apple Television Rumor time! This one comes from the Wall Street Journal. <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/03/wsj-apple-plans-25-ish-channel-tv-service-with-backing-from-abc-cbs-fox/">Apple will supposedly launch a TV service with around 25 channels for around $30-$40 dollars a month</a>. It would include ABC CBS and Fox channels but not NBC because of a dispute with Comcast. However 9to5 Mac has a source that says <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2015/03/17/nbc-plans-cable-dependent-apple-tv-app-for-second-half-of-2015/">NBC wants to launch apps on Apple TV, Fire TV and Xbox in the second half of this year</a>. The new NBC app would require a cable subscription in order to us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Engadget reports that <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/17/google-reviewing-android-apps/?ncid=rss_truncated">Google has started reviewing some apps before they are available for download in the Google Play Store</a>.<br />
The policy, which has been in effect for a few month, uses a mix of algorithms and human intervention.  Google also launched a rating system for Android apps that will label which games are appropriate for various age groups.</p>
<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/03/nintendo-partners-with-dena-to-develop-mobile-phone-games/">Nintendo announced in a press conference that it will partner with mobile game publisher DeNA to make original mobile games using Nintendo characters and worlds</a>. Along with the new games, this autumn Nintendo will launch a cross-platform membership service for mobile devices, PC and Nintendo devices. One of those devices will someday be a new game console referred to as NX. Nintendo called it an “entirely new concept” but we won’t hear any details on that until next year. Ars Technica has one of the best stories rounding up the details.</p>
<p>Engadget reports Microsoft announced <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/17/windows-hello/?ncid=rss_truncated">Windows 10 will support logins by fingerprint, facial recognition and iris scan</a>.  Of course the device it&#8217;s running on has to have the right sensor—- but a framework called Hello will make sure the login experience is consistent across different manufacturers.  For devices without sensors, a feature called Passport lets you enter a password and device-specific PIN.  All the biometric data and the PIN will be stored on the machine.</p>
<p>Engadget notes<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/17/sling-tv-xbox-one/?ncid=rss_truncated"> Sling TV launched today on Xbox One</a>. You can pin Sling TV to your Home screen, control the app with Kinect for Xbox One and Snap with other activities so you can play games and watch Sling TV at the same time. Existing Xbox One owners can try out the service free for a month (up from the usual 7 day trial). If you don’t have an Xbox One you can get 3 months free if you purchase an Xbox One before March 22 2015 from a Microsoft retail outlet or online store.</p>
<p>PC World reports <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2898093/nvidia-fully-reveals-1000-titan-x-the-most-advanced-gpu-ever.html">Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang revealed details about the GeForce Titan X at the GPU Technology Conference</a>.<br />
The card has 3072 CUDA cores, 12 GB of RAM and costs $1,000.<br />
Huang claimed the single-precision floating point performance is 7 TFLOPS but only 200 GFLOPs in double-precision. The one benchmark revealed was neural net analysis.  Titan X can process the data in 1.5 days compared to 5 days for the Titan Black.</p>
<p>ReCode reports <a href="http://recode.net/2015/03/17/nvidia-announces-drive-px-its-self-driving-car-platform/">NVidia also announced a self-driving car platform called Drive PX that will go on sale in May for $10,000</a>. This is the platform teased at CES, powered by two Tegra X1 chips and supposedly 3,000 times faster than DARPA’s DAVE platform. The platform also can be trained and Huang said it gets smarter with every OTA update. NVidia hopes to expand its partnerships with Tesla, Audi and BMW. He’ll probably get his wish with Tesla since Elon Musk joined him on stage to talk about security with self-driving cars.</p>
<p>ReCode reports <a href="http://recode.net/2015/03/17/facebook-messenger-adds-peer-to-peer-payments-feature/">Facebook has launched the ability to send payments through Facebook Messenger at no cost</a>.  Once you’ve tied your debit card to your Facebook account, you can click a dollar sign icon to open a payment screen in messenger.  If someone sends you money and you don’t have a debit card attached, Facebook will hold the money for you until you get it set up.  No payment can be sent without a PIN or thumbprint scan.  The rollout will start in selected US cities and progress internationally later.</p>
<p>3D printing start-up, <a href="http://recode.net/2015/03/16/startup-says-new-3-d-printing-technique-could-shift-use-from-prototype-to-production/">Carbon3D, has developed a new 3-D printing process that works fast enough to be used for production instead of just protyping reports Re/Code</a>. The process is called CLIP or Continuous Liquid Interface Production. CLIP involves using light and oxygen to grow objects from a pool of resin instead of building the object layer by layer. Carbon3D says CLIP is 25-100 times faster than traditional 3-D writing and can work with a wider array of materials. Carbon3D debuted the technology Monday at the TED conference in Vancouver and said they are turning it inot a shipping product but did not state price.</p>
<p><strong>News From You:</strong></p>
<p><strong>tahras</strong> submitted the Verge article that <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/17/8230631/microsoft-is-killing-off-the-internet-explorer-brand">Microsoft marketing chief Chris Capossel told folks at the Microsoft Convergence event that Microsoft is researching a new name for the Project Spartan browser that will come in Windows 10</a>. Testing shows that whatever the name is, it is perceived better if it has the name Microsoft at the beginning. A version of Internet Explorer will also ship with Windows 10 but it will be the last of its name.</p>
<p><strong>KAPT_Kipper</strong> wants you to know that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/16/chromecast-now-lets-you-pause-and-play-with-your-tv-remote/">you can now pause videos on your Google Chromecast with your TV remote</a>. As long as it is infrared and has a play/pause button.  TechCrunch reports that Chromecast uses the HDMI-CEC protocol for the function.  So if starting a cast turns your TV on, then this should work for you.  The functionality doesn&#8217;t work in every app yet but works in many.</p>
<p><strong>tninja3000</strong> sent us the GeekWire report that <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2015/microsoft-band-expanding-to-amazon-target-and-best-buy-launching-in-u-k-with-promise-of-increased-supply/">Microsoft will let third party retailers Amazon, Best Buy and Target sell the Microsoft Band wearable starting today</a>. The fitness and health tracker already available in Microsoft stores costs $199.99 in the US and offers notifications and lightweight apps, and integration with Android, iOS and Windows Phone. The Microsoft Band will also launch April 15th in the UK,for £169.99.</p>

<p>Pick of the day: <a href="streamingnation.com.au,">streamingnation.com.au</a></p>
<p>G&#8217;day Tom, Jenny and Pals</p>
<p>Travis from Melbourne, Australia here &#8211; with a website that might be useful to other Aussies, especially over the next few weeks. It&#8217;s streamingnation.com.au, covering news about the local options for streaming video.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s two Netflix-ish services who&#8217;ve recently launched, being Presto and Stan, but the elephant in the room is Netflix itself (coming next week, baby!)</p>
<p>Streaming Nation also has lists of newly added shows and films, and has recommendations, which I&#8217;m keeping for those nights when my wife just can&#8217;t make up her mind <img src="http://www.dailytechnewsshow.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>Keep up the awesome work.</p>

<p>I am a cablevision internet subscriber. I don&#8217;t have a cable box, only a TiVo . If I subscribed to HBONOW through cablevision, how would I watch? Through apple TV with cable login? Would I have to get a box? If this is the case, why bother? Discounts? Otherwise apple TV would be more convenient, right? Thanks from one of your bosses, Bob</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>Comcast in North Georgia cable modem users here. We have a 300 GB limit&#8230;. and if you cross the magic threshold, they just start charging you some flat rate for each additional 10 or 50 GB or something (I have NOT done this), so now they just make more money from bandwidth hogs.</p>
<p>Woo hoo. No more bandwidth caps. Just what I asked for, sort of.</p>
<p>whistl</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>We asked for legal uses of P2P after the story that Windows 10 updates will be distributed peer to peer. Mink sent us a link to a makeuseof post from August 2013 that mentioned Archive.org, government data sets, BitTorrent Sync, and BitTorrent bundles. Branden from Winterless Salt Lake serves up 6.6 TB of apps and patches via P2P for the 40,000 computers in his school district. And William downloaded the entire BitCoin blockchain shaving a day off the time to get his bitcoin node up and running.</p>
<p>And Mink added the interesting question of “whether &#8220;mobile&#8221; (slower &amp; less reliable networks with more data caps and using inherently smaller storage devices) will make torrents more or less attractive to users. “</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>Hey guys!</p>
<p>A few months back I sent in an audio recording which you played where I discussed the opportunities that are created by GoPro&#8217;s new product with builtin wifi/internet service (hopefully). Meerkat would be crazy not to reach out to them for reasons I am sure you can understand. I shot Meerkats support a brief email as well since they are a fun little startup. They could do great things together.</p>
<p>Thanks!<br />

<p><strong>The Verge</strong> reports <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/16/8223117/facebook-clarifies-community-rules-names-nudity" target="_blank">Facebook updated its community standards page Sunday night to clarify what the policies are</a>. They haven’t actually changed the policy. Among the clarifications Facebook says they want people to use the name they go by regularly, not necessarily their legal name. Hate speech is allowed for satire or commentary. <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2015/03/explaining-our-community-standards-and-approach-to-government-requests/" target="_blank">Nudity is still not allowed but more strictly defined and exceptions made for artwork</a>.</p>

<p><strong>TechCrunch </strong>has covered a new report by the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/16/pew-privacy-chilling-effects/?ncid=rss#TQUNqg:wtiK" target="_blank">Pew Research Center found 30% of US citizens surveyed have taken steps to shield or hide their information from the US government</a>. TechCrunch notes 52% of those surveyed said they were &#8220;very concerned&#8221; or &#8220;somewhat concerned&#8221; by government surveillance programs, but 46% said they were &#8220;not very concerned&#8221; or &#8220;not at all concerned.&#8221; The survey found that 87% of adults have heard at least something about government surveillance programs and 57% said it is unacceptable for the government to monitor the communications of US citizens, but a majority said spying elsewhere is OK. Most often peopleo change privacy settings on social media, avoiding apps entirely and using social media less. Well&#8230; is that about government interference or drunk selfies?</p>

<p>News From You:</p>
<p><strong>Rpattony</strong> posted the TorrentFreak article <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/u-s-net-neutrality-has-a-massive-copyright-loophole-150315/" target="_blank">highlighting another of the many nuggets found in the recent US Open Internet order</a>. “Nothing in this part prohibits reasonable efforts by a provider of broadband Internet access service to address copyright infringement or other unlawful activity.” It is apparently OK for the ISP to determine what is illegal and what is infringement.</p>
<p><strong>Starfuryzeta</strong> sent us this story from the <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/15/8219529/yahoo-on-demand-passwords-and-end-to-end-email-sxsw-2015" target="_blank">Verge reporting on Yahoo’s new Password-free email login</a>. The new approach dubbed “on demand” passwords sends Yahoo email users a time sensitive code through an app or cellphone text message. No more need to remember a password. Every time you login you’ll be sent a new code. Just don&#8217;t lose the phone tied to the account. The new password features is available now and can be enabled from the security section of your account information page.</p>
<p><strong>KAPT_Kipper</strong> found the <a href="http://yahoo.tumblr.com/post/113708033335/user-focused-security-end-to-end-encryption" target="_blank">Yahoo Tumbler post announcing the release of source code for Yahoo’s new end-to-end encryption browser extension for Yahoo Mail</a>. The encryption interface is described as intuitive, however, it will have to be activated each time you want it and info like recipient, subject line and time will remain unencrypted. Yahoo used the Google end to end extension in the project. Yahoo released the source code to GitHub and plans to have end to end encryption available for all users by the end of the year.</p>
<p><strong>Eziwireless</strong> sent us this <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/15/windows-10-peer-to-peer-updates/" target="_blank">Engadget report on Windows 10’s unique update feature</a>. The Verge noticed that a leaked version of Windows 10 lets you grab updates from other PCs whether they’re local or online.This peer-to-peer network patching would accelerate the updating process as well as limiting bandwidth usage on metered internet connections.</p>

<p><strong>Christopher Ragsdale writes</strong>: In listening to this discussion on episode 2448 I was reminded of an interview I had heard recently with author Douglass Rushkoff about his book &#8220;Present Shock&#8221;. Not trying to sell books here. I think you and Jennie might be interested in the info in this book:</p>

<p>Every time y’all talk about how bandwidth caps on home Internet access is a thing of the past, my left eye twitches in a peculiar manner. Y’see, I have Comcast as my ISP. The highest tier home service available in my area (Charleston, SC). And we have a 300GB per month cap. Did I mention that this cap only went into place about a year and a half ago? Surprisingly (or not?), not very long after the cap went into place, Comcast had the infamous share holder call in which the CEO stated flatly that Comcast has no plans to implement bandwidth caps.</p>

<p>TechCrunch reports <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/13/youtube-now-lets-you-upload-360-degree-video/">YouTube now lets you upload and view 360-degree video</a>. You have to run a Python script to check for correct metadata so YouTube recognizes the upload as a 360-degree clip, but YouTube says it’s working on automating that part of the process. Next question: How many of you are going to record360 degree video?</p>
<p><a href="http://opensignal.com/reports/2015/02/state-of-lte-q1-2015/">Open Signal’s State of LTE post is up</a>. Spaion leads the way with fastest LTE at 18 Mbps and Vodafone ES in Spain has the fastets network in the world at 25.5 Mbps. LG U+ in South Korea has the best coverage at 99% and South Korea as whole has the best coverage at 95%. Top 5 countries for speed were Spain, Finland, Denmark, South Korea and Hungary. The Bottom five were Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Mexico, the US and the Philippines.</p>
<p>The Next Web reports that <a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2015/03/13/twitter-confirms-periscope-acquisition-via-retweet/">Twitter finally confirmed it purchased live streaming startup Periscope &#8211; back in January</a>. Periscope tweeted out &#8220;You may have heard some news: It involves a blue bird&#8221; followed by a bunch of hashtags one of which was #WeJoinedTheFlockInJanuary. Twitter then re-tweeted the announcement from its official account. If you haven&#8217;t heard of Periscope until now, its because they haven&#8217;t officially launched yet, and don&#8217;t have a publicly available app. In totally unrelated news, live streaming video app Meerkat has attracted tens of thousands of users since it launched at the end of February.</p>
<p>Excerpts from the book “Becoming Steve Jobs: The Evolution of a Reckless Upstart into a Visionary Leader” by Brent Schlender and Rick Tetzeli are <a href="http://m.bbc.com/news/technology-31869113">spinning out lots of stories ahead of its March 24th release</a>. CultofMac reports among the tidbits are<a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/315360/tim-cook-tried-give-steve-jobs-liver/"> Tim Cook offering to give Jobs part of his liver and being yelled at</a>. Jobs considering partnering with Disney to buy Yahoo. And Jobs telling Jony Ive after his return to Apple in the late 1990s “Apple will never make a TV again.”</p>
<p>MultiChannel.com reports that Moffett Nathanson Research calculated <a href="http://www.multichannel.com/news/technology/google-fiber-ended-2014-29867-tv-subs-report/388806">Google Fiber ended 2014 with 29,867 video subscribers across, Stanford, Provo, and Kansas City based on numbers released by the US Copyright Office today</a>. Moffett noted that counts for just 0.025% of the US video market. He also pointed out that high programming costs have dented deployment and has increased TV/1-Gig bundle prices for new subscribers in KC. Google Fiber’s broadband subscribers, which would higher, aren’t factored in the US Copyright Office’s numbers but Moffett says they are likely to be &#8220;meaningfully higher.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reuters reports <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/12/us-bitcoin-ibm-idUSKBN0M82KB20150312">IBM is considering using the blockchain system used in bitcoin</a>, to create digital cash and payment systems for other currencies. The potential is there to make fast fee-free payments online using currencies like the dollar or the Euro.It would likely not be anonymous as a digital wallet would be linked to a bank account. IBM is seeking the cooperation of central banks like the US Federal Reserve. The Bank of England has stated it considers the blockchain open ledger a significant innovation.</p>
<p>ArsTechnica reports that <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/03/google-to-close-google-code-open-source-project-hosting/">Google will close its Google Code programming project hosting service</a>. Google says the reduced number of users as existing developers migrated to GitHub and Bitbucket and the increased number of spammers and abuse are factors. Google itself moved a number of their open source projects from Google code to GitHub. Google is providing migration tools to export projects to GitHub and Bitbucket, and SourceForge is offering a Google Code project import service. New projects will no longer be accepted as of today and updates to existing projects will not be accepted after August 24th. The site will close down completely January 25, 2016.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/fcc-puts-review-of-comcast-time-warner-at-t-directv-deals-on-hold-1426276188">The US Federal Communications Commission is putting its review of Comcast Corp.’s deal for Time Warner Cable and AT&amp;T Inc.’s planned acquisition of DirecTV on hold</a>, pending a court decision related to the disclosure of video-programming contracts. The FCC says it can’t go forward with the review of these deals until a court determines whether interested parties should be granted limited access to confidential information about the involved companies. The FCC already has these documents and is free to review them on their own, but the broadcasters object to the notion of this sensitive data being shared with people outside of the Commission, even if done under high security and strict non-disclosure agreements.</p>

<p><strong>News From You:</strong></p>
<p><strong>starfuryzeta</strong> submitted the Verge article by Russell Brandom about the new rules for transparency in the US FCC’s Open Internet Order. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/13/8207895/title-ii-fcc-packet-loss-net-neutrality-rules">Packet loss has been added as a metric for ISP’s to make public</a> which led some engineers to fear networks would be forced to add more buffering and latency to juice the stats to look good. However the full order says that packet loss will be listed alongside existing latency and bandwidth reporting.</p>
<p><strong>KAPT_Kipper</strong> sent us this story from ArsTechnica that since the middle of 2013, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/03/epic-google-snafu-leaks-hidden-whois-data-for-280000-domains/">Google Apps for Work leaked hidden whois data attached to 282,867 domains</a>. A bug in the way Google Apps integrated with eNom’s com registration program interface caused private whois info including names, phone numbers, email and physical addresses to be leaked when domains were renwed. Cisco Systems research discovered the flaw Feb 19 and five days later the leak was patched. eNom charged an extra $6/yr to shield the info from public view.</p>

<p>Hey Tom and Jenny,</p>
<p>For Valentines day my wife subscribed to HBO via my ATT Uverse cable. For several weeks I&#8217;ve been getting caught up with Game of Thrones which I&#8217;ve only been watching in the 5am EST hour on ROKU, when I&#8217;ve been running on my treadmill&#8230;.Not a single problem. Tonight and for the first time I watched an episode on my XBOX One and it happened to be during prime time. It was extremely choppy would have to wait for queuing of the show just about every minute (not exaggerating). &#8230; Are the cable companies grasping at straws and slowing down online content at certain hours to make the consumer want to keep watching via the cable box? While I most certainly hope not&#8230;I can&#8217;t help but think they are.</p>
<p>Not quite an executive producer, but close. &#8211; David Wilke</p>
<p>========</p>
<p>I wanted to throw a totally self-promotional pick out there for your European fans. I put together a special 30-minute programme for my new podcast Tech&#8217;s Message about the European Apple Watch. It&#8217;s had some amazing feedback and in the interest of also trying to get some more ears on the show I hoped you might be interested in checking it out.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s at natelanxon.com/podcast and marked as a special edition, and is in all the iTunes stores and podcatcher directories under Tech&#8217;s Message.</p>
<p>Looking forward to joining you on the show soon! Nate</p>

<p><b>Show Notes</b></p>
<p>Today&#8217;s guest: Justin Robert Young</p>
<p>&#8220;As Ars Technica reports <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/03/400-page-net-neutrality-order-includes-80-pages-of-republican-dissents/">the FCC released its report on “Protecting and Promoting the Open Internet”.</a> In the 400 page document the rules themselves make up 8 pages. The rest is commentary and analysis including a 64-page dissent from Commissioner Ajit Pai and a 16-page dissent from Commissioner Michael O’Reilly. Among the analysis are the forebearances from Title II which include this line that will cause most of the debate: &#8220;&#8221;we do not forbear from<br />
sections 201, 202, and 208.&#8221;&#8221; The rules will now be published in the Federal Register within a week or two. 60 days after that happens the rules go into effect, except for additions to the transparency rules which require approval by the Office of Management and Budget. Let the parsing BEGIN!&#8221;</p>
<p>Recode reports that <a href="http://recode.net/2015/03/11/apple-stops-selling-jawbone-up-nike-fuelband-in-stores-making-way-for-the-apple-watch/">Apple has stopped selling Jawbone Up, and Nike + FuelBand in its stores ahead of the Apple Watch launch</a>. The Mio, a heart tracking device worn on the wrist, can only be found in Apple&#8217;s online store. Recode checked stores in San Francisco, Palo Alto, Los Angeles and New York. The CEO of Mio said Apple notified her a few months ahead of time that the tracker would be removed from the store, citing a desire to &#8220;rework branding for the stores, and to make the Apple brand more front and center&#8221; and “minimize the number of accessories.”</p>
<p>Bloomberg Business reports that <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-11/apple-researchkit-sees-thousands-sign-up-amid-bias-criticism">11,000 people have already signed up for a Stanford University cardiovascular study using Apple&#8217;s Research Kit</a>. The medical director of Stanford&#8217;s Cardiovascular Heath department said that getting 10,000 people enrolled in a medical study would normally take a year, and 50 medical centers around the country. The article also notes some researchers are skeptical that the data won&#8217;t be skweed by the type of participant or rendered controversial by things like unclear consent forms. Way to harsh Stanford&#8217;s mellow, Bloomberg Business.</p>
<p>Buzzfeed reports that <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/twitter-tackles-revenge-porn#.avpL3ow32">Twitter has issued new rules that say &#8220;You may not post intimate photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject’s consent</a>.&#8221; and says it will lock the accounts of users who violate the rule. The company also issued a new FAQ regarding stolen nudes and revenge porn which they posted on reddit. Users can report possible violations through Twitter&#8217;s reporting process.</p>
<p>Reuters reports that <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/11/us-facebook-classaction-idUSKBN0M724720150311">U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman in San Jose said Tuesday that plaintiffs can bring a class action against Facebook regarding online purchases by children</a>. Facebook argued against a class action, saying the claims were too disparate, and an injunction would not address them. The parents of two children who made large amounts of in app purchases brought the suit in April 2012. It says Facebook violated California law by refusing refunds under its &#8220;all sales are final&#8221; policy when the parents complained. A trial date is set for October 19th.</p>
<p>Bloomberg has sources that say <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-11/alibaba-said-to-plan-snapchat-funding-at-15-billion-valuation">Alibaba will invest $200 million in Snapchat based on a valuation of $15 billion</a>. Snapchat is supposedly seeking a round of $500 million of investment. CB Insights says the valuation ranks it right behind Uber at $40 billion and Xiaomi at $45 billion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Reuters reports <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/12/us-alibaba-group-hiring-usa-idUSKBN0M810920150312">Alibaba is hiring in Seattle for positions related to cloud computing</a>. Microsoft and Amazon, also in the Seattle area, also do cloud computing. Alibaba has already hired 10 software engineers or computing experts from either Microsoft or Amazon since July 2014. Alibaba launched its first cloud computing hub outside of China on March 4 in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Reuters reports <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/11/lyft-drivers-idUSL1N0WD2ME20150311">US District Judges Edward Chen and Vince Chhabria in San Francisco federal court said in two rulings that the status of drivers for Uber and Lyft will need to be decided by juries</a>. Both companies face class action lawsuits on behalf of drivers who want the benefits of being employees not independent contractors.</p>
<p>The BBC is working with <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/1-million-uk-children-to-be-given-a-free-computer/#ftag=CAD590a51e">Samsung, Microsoft, ARM and the people behind Raspberry Pi to give 1 million 11 year-olds in the UK a free computer reports CNET</a>. The low cost machine, still in development, is called the Micro Bit, and is similar to the Raspberry Pi and Arduino. The unit fits inside the palm of a child&#8217;s hand and sports a simple array of LED lights as a display plus Bluetooth. It launches this September and will support Python, C++, and Touch Develop. The BBC will also launchshows about programming as well as a new drama based on the development of Grand Theft Auto along with a documentary on Bletchley Park.</p>
<p>Reuters reports <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/12/us-xiaomi-india-idUSKBN0M80PU20150312">Xiaomi will being local production of devices in India within 12 to 18 months</a>. Xiaomi has sold more than a million phones in 5 months in India. Xiaomi is also looking to invest in start-ups and service centers and will open 100 stores in the country to help consumers &#8220;experience&#8221; the phones. So you&#8217;ll be able to walk into a store in India and by a Mi Phone? No. Xiaomi insist on continuing to use online flash sales and Flipkart.com to actually sell phones.</p>
<p>The Next Web reports<a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2015/03/12/uk-spies-were-fired-for-inappropriately-accessing-personal-data-says-intelligence-and-security-committee/"> a new UK Parliamentary report from the Intelligence and Security Committee revealing how the agencies gathered bulk personal data</a>, and recommending Britain’s laws governing those agencies should be overhauled. Some members of the UK’s intelligence services have been fired for &#8220;inappropriately&#8221; accessing personal data. The report concludes that existing laws were not broken and bulk data collection did not amount to mass surveillance or threaten privacy.</p>
<p>If you’ve seen the video going around of a laughing Spanish man subtitled as if he’s telling the story of how the new MacBook was created, the Next Web would like you to know.<a href="http://thenextweb.com/shareables/2015/03/12/hate-the-new-macbook-this-old-spanish-man-agrees-with-you/"> Juan Joya, a Spanish actor and comedian known as El Risita</a>s. If you don’t speak the language, the story he’s actually telling is about washing pots and pans in the ocean. It is the new “Hitler Reacts.”</p>
<p>Bad news in chip town. <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/12/us-intel-forecast-idUSKBN0M81JU20150312">Reuters reports Intel cut its revenue forecast for Q1 from $13.7 billion to $12.8 billion</a> +- $300 million, citing lower-than-expected demand for business PCs and lower inventory levels across the PC supply chain.</p>
<p><strong>News From You</strong></p>

<p><strong>Pick of the day: <a href="tapiriik.com">tapiriik.com</a></strong></p>
<p>I had wanted to keep this one to myself as it is so useful but it’s probably time to share…</p>
<p>I am a keen runner and will change running tracking app depending on features or, for example, whether my Garmin is charged! I also like to keep a backup of my runs on Dropbox. Have a look at the site – he supports all major providers – a massive selection and it keeps growing.</p>
<p>There is only one service which allows this &#8211; <a href="tapiriik.com">tapiriik.com</a>. It is run by a chap called Colin Fair who offers great support. Best of all, it’s free for manual syncing. If you want automagic syncing, it costs a paltry $2 per year.</p>
<p>Oh, and it isn’t limited to running, but all sports. It will even sync activities marked private and keep them private.</p>
<p>I encourage listeners to try it and to pay for it!</p>
<p>Love the show, as ever.</p>

<p>Hello Tom,<br />
Another issue with MLB tv is, if you are in between markets, you are considered part of their viewing areas. I live in Charlotte and when I subscribed two years ago I was considered to be in the Atlanta Braves, Washington Nationals, Baltimore Orioles, and for some reason the Cincinnati Reds markets. As a Chicago Cubs and Boston Red Sox fan it seemed like every game I tried to watch was blacked out because of markets or national broadcasting rights, so I cancelled the service. Thanks for the great work.<br />

<p><b>Show Notes</b></p>
<p>Today&#8217;s guest: <a href="https://twitter.com/Eklund">Eklund</a> of <a href="http://www.hockeybuzz.com/">hockeybuzz.com </a></p>
<p>If you were frightened scared and alone because of the <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/102495735">Apple iTunes outage rest assured</a>. Apple told CNBC “The cause was an internal DNS error at Apple.”</p>
<p>ReCode reports that one US FCC Official says t<a href="http://recode.net/2015/03/11/new-net-neutrality-rules-expected-to-be-released-thursday/">he new Open Internet Rules are expected to be made public tomorrow</a>. After which people can stop saying &#8220;we haven&#8217;t seen the rules yet&#8221; and move on to arguing about what the rules will actually mean in practice.</p>
<p>Along with lifting NDA’s on Google Pixel laptop reviews, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/11/google-launches-new-online-store-to-showcase-hardware-made-with-google/?ncid=rss">Google also launched an online store to feature its hardware at store.google.com</a>. If you’re looking for official Nexus versions of phones, tablets, watches and more that’s where you’ll find them now. TechCrunch notes this means devices will no longer be a section in the Google Play store which will focus on apps and media.</p>
<p>And if you’re in London The Telegraph notes <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/11462726/Google-opens-first-ever-Google-Shop-in-London.html">Google has opened a physical store of sorts inside Currys PC World on London’s Tottenham Court Road</a>. The Google Shop will have all its devices, conduct tutorials and demonstrations and feature lovely blonde hardwood tables. The “shop within a shop” should also come to Currys PC World in Fulham west London and Thurrock Essex.</p>
<p>And our hat trick of Google news comes thanks to PC Mag.<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2478143,00.asp"> Google Nearline is a beta cloud storage offering for 1 cent per GB with a promised response time of 3 seconds</a>. It’s meant as a soft replacement for cold storage of data that still gives you reasonably fast access when an unexpected need arises.It will have redundant locations, OAuth and be fully integrated with other Google Cloud storage options.</p>
<p>TechCrunch passes along the WSJ report that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/11/apple-pegged-to-bring-force-touch-pressure-sensitive-input-to-next-iphones/?ncid=rss">Apple will add the Force Touch feature of the new MacBook to the next version of the iPhone</a>. Force Touch senses the force of a touch, hence the name, which can be used as a contextual menu selection or to provide finer control of things like games.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/11/8189565/facebook-removes-feeling-fat-emoticon-petition">Facebook has removed the “Feeling Fat” emoticon option</a> after 16,000 people signed an online petition at Change.org reports the Verge. “Feeling Fat” was a recent addition to a list that Facebook users could add to their statuses. Petitioners argued that “fat is not a feeling” and that the emoticon encouraged negative body image among girls. While “feeling fat” a “Feeling Stuffed” status can still be chosen.</p>
<p>The Verge passes on the news from The Wall Street Journal that <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/11/8190749/sony-playstation-vue-launching-two-weeks">Sony&#8217;s internet TV service, Playstation Vue will launch in New York City, Chicago and Philadelphia in the next two weeks</a>. Selected users have been testing the service in those cities for a few months. PSVue (not to be confused with PS2) will deliver around 75 broadcast and cable channels like CBS FOX NBC Comedy Central, FX, Discovery. Users can watch live or store recorded shows for 28 days. Still no word on cost. The goal is to roll out Vue nationwide by the end of 2015.</p>
<p>Oh did you say you wanted MORE on demand video services? Well, Recode reports that <a href="http://recode.net/2015/03/11/verizons-video-service-is-coming-this-summer-and-will-feature-stuff-from-dreamworks-and-awesomenesstv/">Verizon announced a programming deal with DreamWorks Animation&#8217;s AwesomenessTV unit</a> to provide more than 200 hours of new shows across two channels one for teens and one for families, featuring DreamWorks most recognizable characters. So, Shrek. According to Verizon CEO Fran Shammo, the service is aimed at people who want to watch video via a wireless connection, which likely means on phones and tablets. No word on cost just yet but it&#8217;s expected to launch this summer.</p>
<p><strong>News From You:</strong></p>
<p><strong>habichuelacondulce</strong> sent us the Engadget version of a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/10/the-cia-is-giving-its-surveillance-tech-to-us-law-enforcement/">WSJ story that the US Justice Department is using the Cessna mounted electronic sniffer boxes called dirtboxes</a>. Theses are the boxes that mimic the behavior of cell towers intercepting ID and registration information. A $100 million flying man-in-the-middle attack. The technology, developed for use in the Middle East, has been repurposed by the US Marshals Service with help of the CIA and Boeing. The EFF and ACLU have filed Freedom of Information Act requests regarding the program plus additional information about the acquisition, possession and use of cell site simulators.</p>
<p><strong>zuntax</strong> alerted to us a Verge story <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/11/8189455/playstation-mobile-closing">on the end of the PlayStation Mobile platform</a>. PlayStation Mobile was Sony’s store for indie games and classic PlayStation games for the PS Vita and selected Android Phones. No new content will publish after July 15th and by Sept 10th you’ll no longer be able to re-download games you already own.</p>
<p>And <strong>goofball_jones</strong> wanted us to note a column from David Post at the Washington Post about <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/03/09/icann-copyright-infringement-and-the-public-interest/">the pressure being put on ICANN to fight copyright infringement through its issuance of domain names</a>. Post notes prohibiting end-users from copyright infringement is in ICANN’s contract with registrars but asks if a domain name administrator should be enforcing intellectual property law. Definitely worth a read.</p>

<p><strong>Pick of the day:</strong> Bosch on Amazon Prime via Stan Cook</p>
<p>You guys need to check out<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Chapter-One-Tis-the-Season/dp/B00I3MMLHC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1426144919&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=bosch+amazon"> Bosch on Amazon Prime</a>. One of the pilots from last year that made it. A real good detective series.<br />
Best Regards, Stan Cook</p>

<p>Derrick Chen chimes in:<br />
&#8220;advertising&#8217;s latest fad, programmatic buying, shifts from working directly with sites to automated processes that focus on select inventory or targeted audiences, and prevents sites from selling traditional buys where a lump sum buys a certain amount of media over time. This is particularly challenging for smaller and medium independent sites who can&#8217;t provide the reach and scale advertisers need. With that, to your point Tom, we&#8217;ll most likely see more sites fold or merge into larger groups. So to the discussion yesterday, it&#8217;s not just competition within the category, we&#8217;re seeing fundamental shifts in the way the web is used and sold. Is it too early to say web 3.0?&#8221;</p>
<p>=========</p>
<p>Hi Tom,<br />
&#8230; I think there&#8217;s another reason why display advertising on the web isn&#8217;t growing fast enough &#8211; paid content. This has become so widespread that advertisers expect to be able to buy editorial and almost seem to be puzzled when they find out that they can&#8217;t.<br />
Greg Lane</p>
<p>==========</p>
<p>Alex adds. &#8220;there is and always will be a limited supply of good talent, in this case quality journalists who know what they&#8217;re doing and provide compelling news and content that people want to read, which will be monetarily more valuable. The other limitation is audience attention.</p>
<p>In short, only the cream will rise to the top. This can applied anywhere: news, podcasting, clothing retail, dog walkers, you name it.&#8221;</p>
<p>==========</p>
<p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>Your story about the CIA creating a hacked version of XCode and OS X reminds me of a really old story about Ken Thompson hacking the login program to capture passwords. Then he hacked the C compiler to insert the login hack when compiling the login program. Then he hacked to C compiler to insert the C compiler hack when compiling the C compiler. He then gets people to use this compromised C compiler, and once they do, they can&#8217;t get rid of the hack. If they recompile login, or even the C compiler itself, the system is still compromised. And it completely passes source code inspection. It would require inspecting the output of the C compiler to realize it was up to something.</p>
<p>The optimistic interpretation is that you have to trust someone, or anything can be compromised. The pessimistic one is trust nothing, since anything can be compromised.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t heard this story before, you can search for Ken Thompson Hack or Ken Thompson Reflections on Trusting Trust to read the details.</p>
<p>Thanks for reminding me of an interesting story on a crazy news day.</p>
<p>&#8211;Alan</p>

<p>TechCrunch reports an <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/10/the-apple-watch-battery-is-replaceable/">Apple Spokesman confirmed the Apple Watch battery is replaceable and the lifecycle is about three years</a>. The Next Web has a good breakdown of <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apple/2015/03/10/apple-watch-battery-life-which-type-of-user-will-you-be/">the way Apple calculates battery life.</a> The 18 hours of typical use means 90 time checks, 5 per hour, 90 notifications, 45 minutes total app use and a 30-minute workout with Bluetooth. Other estimates are that total talk time is 3 hours. Total music over Bluetooth is 6.5 hours. Heart rate sensor use runs 7 hours. And if you do nothing but check the time you should get 48 hours. Charging up from empty takes 1.5 hours to 80% and 2.5 hours to full.</p>

<p>The Intercept reports on <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/03/10/ispy-cia-campaign-steal-apples-secrets/">documents leaked by Edward Snowden from a security gathering called the “jamboree” sponsored by the CIA’s Information Operations Center and held on a Lockheed campus in Northern Virginia</a>. Researchers from Sandia National Laboratories discussed a modified Xcode that put secret backdoors into apps— a modified OS X updater that could install a keylogger— and attempts to break encryption on iOS firmware. Attacks against Microsoft devices were also discussed.</p>
<p>The Next Web reports that<a href="http://thenextweb.com/us/2015/03/10/wikimedia-foundation-sues-nsa-to-challenge-mass-surveillance/"> The Wikimedia Foundation is joining Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and 6 other organizations to sue the National Security Agency and the US Department of Justice over the NSA&#8217;s mass surveillance program</a>. Wikimedia says that the intelligence agency’s methods captures communications by its users and staff, thereby violating their privacy and threatening intellectual freedom.</p>
<p>Yesterday <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/09/pioneering-tech-blog-gigaom-is-shutting-down/?ncid=rss">the tech news blog GigaOm came to a sudden halt</a>.  A post on the site said GigaOm was unable to pay its creditors and had ceased operations. Founder Om Malik, who is no longer working on the site, expressed regret and thanked its workers and readers.  The company does not intend to file for bankruptcy but it’s eventual fate is unclear.</p>
<p>The Verge reports a “source knowledgeable with Android Wear&#8217;s product road map” says<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/10/8181069/android-wear-update-wi-fi-support-gesture-control"> the next software release will add WiFi support</a>, gesture support like flicking the wrist to scroll, and easier access to apps and contact.</p>
<p>The Verge has the news that <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/10/8181919/playstation-4-china-release-date-march-20th">the Playstation 4 and PlayStation Vita are going on sale in China on March 20th</a>.  The PS4 will code 2,889 yuan (about $464) and the Vita will sell for 1,299 yuan ($207). Chinese officials banned foreign game consoles in 2000, driving most gamers to PCs or mobile devices.  The prohibition was lifted in 2013, and Microsoft launched the Xbox One in September 2014.</p>
<p>The Daily Dot reports the UK’s Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology issued a briefing saying <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/politics/uk-briefing-tor-child-abuse-minor-role/">a ban on data encryption and online anonymity is neither acceptable nor feasible</a>. Earlier this year UK Prime Minister David Cameron pledged to ban encryption on the web and end online anonymity to combat terrorism and child pornography. The briefing specifically mentioned TOR as a tool used to bypass censors and the difficulty foreign censors have had in blocking it. Furthermore it noted that 1,624 domains were found to have child abuse material on the open Web, while 36 were found on the Dark Net.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reports the app <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/10/yik-yak-has-been-delisted-on-google-play-since-october/">Yik Yak seems to have been delisted from the Google Play store</a>. The anonymous localized chat app can be found in search but is not listed on any charts. Yik Yak is listed as #20 in social on iOS. Several college campuses in the US have banned the app recently because of the offensive and abusive nature of some postings.</p>

<p><strong>Pick of the Day:  <a href="http://synergy-project.org">Synergy Project</a> via Satya</strong></p>
<p>Satya: Hi Tom,</p>
<p>My pick is Synergy Project, http://synergy-project.org.</p>
<p>It is a pretty cool and very useful software for a sharing a single keyboard and mouse across multiple computers without any additional hardware.</p>
<p>It costs 10$ and works on all operating systems. It is worth every penny.</p>
<p><strong>Messages:</strong></p>
<p>Hi Tom-</p>
<p>When I saw the new USB port world serve as charger and it&#8217;s some input, I freaked at first. When I thought about it, I realized with modern battery life, Wi-Fi, cloud storage, and Bluetooth, ports are less useful than they were in the past.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad they kept the headphone jack since Bluetooth audio fidelity still isn&#8217;t quite to to snuff yet. I&#8217;m hoping future Wi-Fi specs can support multiple connections to connect wireless storage or wifi headphones or speakers while not cutting off your network access. Pull that off and we might enter a brave new portless world.</p>
<p>Thanks for the great work!</p>

<p>================</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, guys. A quick thought on the new MacBooks.</p>
<p>To understand how Apple is positioning them, I think it makes sense to consider its specs:<br />
Retina screen.<br />
M-class processor (which doesn&#8217;t require a fan).<br />
Extremely thin and light.<br />
Just two ports (power/data and audio).<br />
Emphasis on touch interaction.<br />
Three colors.<br />
Sort of reminds me of an iPad.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s really meant for people who are tired of trying to combine an iPad with a keyboard in order to get real work done. In other words, in my opinion, the new MacBook is the best iPad Apple&#8217;s ever made (and I want one).</p>

<p>Remember FriendFeed? Remember Facebook bought it in 2009? Well you can forget about it. <a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2015/03/09/facebook-is-killing-off-friendfeed-on-april-9/">Platform posts and messages will go away April 9.</a></p>
<p><strong>News From You:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Zuntax </strong>sent us an Engadget report about <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/08/court-rules-on-location-data-warrants/">a cell phone privacy nugget embedded deep in federal drug case</a>. The defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence, which the court denied. But within that ruling, the judge determined that police officers need a warrant to get phone location data, because a cell phone user has a reasonable expectation that their position data will remain private, even when limited to information about what cell tower was used. The ruling isn&#8217;t legally binding, but does serve as a notice to police not to play fast and loose with evidence gathering, at least not in California.</p>
<p><strong>KAPT_Kipper</strong> and <strong>MacBytes</strong> sent us the BBC report that <a href="http://m.bbc.com/news/science-environment-31772140">a solar powered aircraft &#8220;Solar Impulse-2&#8243; completed its first leg of an around-the-world trip</a>. The aircraft took off from Abu Dhabi and landed in Oman after a 12 hour flight. The pane will circumnavigate the globe over the next five months. Andre Borschbeg and famed baloonist Betrand Piccard will swap piloting duties. The plane has 17,000 solar cells lining the top of the wings, and uses lithium-ion batteries to store power for night flying.</p>
<p><strong>habichuelacondulce</strong> sent in the Bloomberg report that <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-09/tesla-cuts-jobs-in-china-as-sales-slower-than-expected">Tesla said it is cutting jobs in China</a>. The Chinese Economic Observer reported the company would reduce staff by 30%. Tesla spokesman Gary Tao said the changes started at the beginning of the year. CEO Elon Musk said in January that Chinese sales were slow because of concerns over charging.</p>

<p><strong>Pick of the Day: </strong></p>
<p>My pick of the day is your old android phone if you have one. They make great dedicated remotes for your Chromecast. If you old phone won&#8217;t sell for much, wipe it and install just your entertainment apps. You may get a little extra speed out of the old phone if you can root it and install a ROM without any bloatware like Cyanogenmod. Improve battery life by putting into airplane mode, and then just turning on WiFi.<br />

<p>Hey Tom it&#8217;s been a busy week, but I seem to recall you talking about wireless device charging vs USB ports recently&#8230; Just to be clear; some systems like the Powermat being installed at Starbucks does charge the device via inductive coils with the ability to also send data back to Starbucks.</p>
<p>The power receiver changes the load presented to the transmitting coil, the frequency of this load change allows the system to read the ID of the device being charged. So the system CAN track users. When built into a device it would be unclear to the user how much access this system would have to other data stored on the device. After market adapters most likely would only be able to ID the same adapter since the adapter would only connect to the on board battery.</p>
<p>For public charging, I&#8217;ll stick with a USB cable that only has the power pins connected.</p>

<p>Tom et al.,</p>
<p>This is Steve from ‘getting the rain out of our system, before SXSW starts’ Austin. After hearing Darren talk about Club Mate on the show yesterday, I thought your listeners might want to know that it is now being widely distributed in the US. In Austin alone there are seven retailers selling it, and The 2600 Club in Brooklyn will ship you a case anywhere in the US.</p>
<p>This link has a tool to show the retail locations near you:</p>

Microsoft has issued workarounds for Windows Vista and newer. Windows Server 2003 does not have a workaround. Microsoft has seen no evidence of the attack in the wild but will issue an update, possibly out of band. Both the browser and server must be vulnerable for the exploit to work. You can visit https://freakattack.com/ for information on browser patches.</p>

<p><strong>News From You: </strong></p>
<p><strong>thelouisguy</strong> sent us this story from CBC that Alain Philippon of Quebec has been charged with hindering or preventing border officers from performing their role because <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/quebec-resident-alain-philippon-to-fight-charge-for-not-giving-up-phone-password-at-airport-1.2982236">he refused to give Canadian border security the password to his phone</a>. According to the Candian Border Services Agency the minimum fine is $1000 up to a maximum of $25,000. Philipon plans to fight the charge. Travelers crossing most borders have a reduced privacy rights. The Canadian Border Services Agency would not say why Philippon was asked for the password. IN astatement the agency said, &#8220;Officers are trained to look for indicators of deception and use a risk management approach in determining which goods may warrant a closer look.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>HobbitfromPA</strong> sent us the Phandroid post that <a href="http://phandroid.com/2015/03/06/google-carrier-nexus-6/">only owners of the Nexus 6 will be able to use Google’s wireless carrier announced earlier this week at Mobile World Congress</a>. The Wall Street Journal has the sources on this. Google’s service will combine WiFi with LTE using other carriers networks. We’ll no doubt hear more about it at Google I/O, May 28.</p>

<p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>Derek from lovely &#8220;wait did we really go straight from fall to spring?&#8221; Eugene, Oregon here. In my (just thought of) capacity as DTNS AWS Co-executive producer I thought I&#8217;d weigh in on the discussion of MLB Advanced Media&#8217;s capacity for things like WWE and HBO.</p>
<p>In the first keynote of the 2014 re:Invent conference last November the CTO of MLBAM gave a brief talk on the tools and architecture that they are able to leverage with AWS to achieve greater and greater scale all the time. As someone who oversees an AWS based SaaS product that gets millions of pageviews a day I can tell you that capacity is a much more complicated equation than just number of servers but the tools to achieve truly elastic and practically limitless capacity are getting better on a daily basis. For a company as sophisticated as MLBAM running on a platform like AWS the past means very little in being able to predict how they will fair with the new load from HBO Now.</p>
<p>For viewers that are interested the talk from the MLB CTO is in the day 1 keynote and starts at the 16 minute mark here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp0Qv4N3uXQ</p>

<p>Mobile World Congress? Tech reporters are most concerned with how to smuggle jamón iberico out of the country in their pants. GDC? Hungover. <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/apple-said-to-delay-larger-ipad-production-on-panel-challenges">BUT This coming Monday is an Apple announcement</a>. And so the rumors are flooding in to fill the gap! Here. We. Go.</p>
<p><span id="more-3162"></span></p>
<p>Bloomberg says <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/314301/ipad-pro-may-boast-superior-display-usb-3-0-ports/">the never announced 12.9-inch screen iPad will be delayed until September for manufacturers</a>. Some people call the delay of rumored products “starting.”</p>
<p>The WSJ adds the imaginary product will have <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/314301/ipad-pro-may-boast-superior-display-usb-3-0-ports/">a more power-efficient Oxide LCD screen and a USB 3.0 port</a>. The WSJ adds the imaginary product will have a more power-efficient Oxide LCD screen and a USB 3.0 port.</p>
<p><a href="http://9to5mac.com/2015/03/05/12-inch-macbook-air-2/">WSJ ALSO says a 12-inch MacBook Air will be announced Monday</a>.</p>
<p>And 9to5 Mac reports <a href="https://gigaom.com/2015/03/05/why-a-new-12-inch-macbook-air-could-debut-alongside-apple-watch/">Apple will NOT announce a new live streaming music service Monday.</a></p>
<p>TechCrunch says<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/05/apples-streaming-music-service-will-debut-in-june/?ncid=rss"> that mythical service will debut at WWDC in Jun</a>e</p>
<p>I can confirm from asking myself that <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2015/03/05/apple-plans-relaunched-beats-streaming-music-service-for-wwdc-skipping-march-event/">Apple will also not announce a car, a television, or a space rocket or Monday.</a></p>
<p>The Verge reports that <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/5/8153299/office-2016-for-mac-2016-features-preview">Office 2016 for Mac is about to catch back up to Windows</a>. The last version was released in 2010. Microsoft today announced a preview program for the new Office 2016 for Mac. Major points: Cloud services will be integrated directly into the suite of programs, Word will get co-authoring, and Excel keyboard shortcuts are now consistent between Mac and PC versions. Microsoft wants it ready in time for summer. The company has not yet announced pricing or exact availability dates, but a standalone version is expected.</p>
<p>The Verge reports <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/4/8150237/imgur-iphone-new-app-launch">Imgur has launched a new iPhone app that gives viewers an endless row of swipeable pictures with titles</a>. To comment, like or dislike, or read comments just double tap the picture. When you first open the app the most “viral” images are shown to you first but there are also options for random and latest submissions as well. You can&#8217;t upload through the app yet, but that feature is in the works. A new version for Android is also coming soon.</p>
<p>Fit-solidation is official. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/05/fitbit-confirms-fitstar-acquisition-to-bring-training-to-its-fitness-portfolio/?ncid=rss">TechCrunch reports Fitbit confirmed the acquisition of FitStar, makers of a personal training app that creates customized workouts with celeb athletes like NFL star Tony Gonzalez and yogi Tara Stiles</a>. FitStar has two million registered iOS users. Fitbit co-founder and CEO James Park says the company also plans to expand FitStar to other platforms.</p>
<p>Look out Progressive Insurance, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/05/google-compare-car-insurance-us/">TechCrunch reports Google is launching “Google Compare for Auto Insurance” which lets California shoppers compare rates from different insurance providers</a>. The option will pop up after a consumer does a Google search for “car insurance” or by going to google.com/compare. Google plans to offer it other states later in the year. While the move could help bolster revenue for Google through commissions many high profile insurance brokers like Progressive, State Farm, Allstate and GEICO have declined to work with Google. TechCrunch speculates that Google might also be doing this to learn about pricing risk in advance of self-driving cars.</p>
<p>Engadget reports that 2009 is back! I mean, RockBand is back! <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/05/rock-band-4/?ncid=rss_truncated">Rock Band 4 is coming to Xbox One and Playstation 4 later this year.</a> Harmonix says all previous songs will work in Rock Band 4. The company wants to make old peripherals work but there will also be new peripherals. Also no news on Rock Band Network. This will be a platform for DLC it seems. Harmonix will talk more about Rock Band 4 this weekend at PAX East in Boston, and in June at E3 2015.</p>
<p><strong>News From You: </strong></p>
<p><strong>ccastro425</strong> posted the Engadget story about <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/04/lockheed-martin-laser-athena-test/">a laser from LockHeed Martin that can stop a car from more than a mile away</a>. The fiber-optic laser called ATHENA burned through the engine manifold of an F150. It works by “spectral beam combining which involces taking multiple laser modules and pointing them to the same place. Like the death star. And no the truck didn’t explode, just stopped running.</p>
<p><strong>AB-ee-CHWAY-lah-con-DOOL-say</strong> submitted the PC World report that Phil Spencer, head of Xbox, said <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2893412/microsoft-opens-up-xbox-one-to-app-developers.html">Microsoft is opening up app development for the Xbox One</a>. Windows developers will be able to port their apps to the Xbox. Microsoft wants to make Xbox Live accessible through the API to all game developers no matter how big.</p>
<p><strong>Michsineath</strong> submitted this topic. <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/05/us-europe-ebooks-tax-idUSKBN0M11A120150305">The Cost of eBooks in France and Luxembourg won’t be going down anytime soon reports Reuters. </a>Judges at the European Court of Justice today, dismissed arguments by both countries that ebooks should be treated as goods not a service. EU rules allow member states to set lower VAT rates on printed books, however the European Commission decided that France and Luxembourg&#8217;s application of those rates to electronic books was illegal. Statista predicts ebook sales in Europe are expected to account for a fifth of book sales in Europe by 2017 up from 4.5% in 2013.</p>

<p><strong>Pick of the Day:<a href="https://justgetflux.com/"> </a><a href="https://www.moh.io/mohiomap/welcome.php">Mohiomap</a> via Michelle</strong></p>
<p>Dear Tom, Jennie, today&#8217;s guest and behind the scenes DTNS team,</p>
<p>I would like to recommend Mohiomap, to DTNS followers. This developing site is a visual cloud based, free, curation tool, currently combines, Google drive, Evernote and Dropbox, with more services in the pipeline to be added.</p>
<p>Certainly helps to visualise and manage all the resources one has stored across these various platforms. IMHO A new service worth checking out, supporting, testing and giving feedback too.</p>
<p>https://www.moh.io/mohiomap/welcome.php</p>
<p>Thanks for the great show.</p>
<p>BFN<br />

<p>As the Verge tells it, in a surprise appearance at Epic Games’ GDC 2015 event, NVIDIA co-founder <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/4/8148999/nvidia-announces-titan-x-the-new-most-powerful-gpu-on-the-planet">Jen-Hsun Huang announced the Titan X, Nvidia’s most powerful GPU to date</a>. The GPU will contain 8 billion transistors and 12 GB of VRAM. Sites like Anandtech have speculated the GPU to be an enlarged Maxwell processor possibly featuring a 384-bit memory bus. Nvidia’s own GPU technology conference happens in two weeks and more details about Titan X are expected then.</p>
<p>Engadget reports on <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/03/valve-lighthouse-vr/">Valve’s announcement of a VR input System and Lighthouse</a>, a room-scale tracking system that will work with Valve VR headsets like the Vive coming from HTC later this year. The system can integrate into TVs, monitors, headsets, input devices or mobile devices and will be made available freely to hardware manufacturers. Valve will make a developer version of their VR headset available this spring.</p>
<p>Polygon reports<a href="http://www.polygon.com/2015/3/3/8145273/valve-source-2-announcement-free-developers"> Valve will release Steam Link in November, for streaming games from computers running Steam at 1080p and 60 Hz</a>. It will cost $50, the same price as the Steam controller. . Steam Machines will also launch in November. Valve also introduced a successor to their Source game engine Source 2 for free. A special version will be compatible with the Vulkan 3D graphics API. No release date though.</p>

<p>The Verge reports <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/4/8149599/john-carmack-gear-vr-samsung-full-launch-fall-2015">Oculus Chief Technology officer John Carmack said that Oculus will go forward “as hard as we can” to sell the next version of the Samsung Gear VR</a>. While Carmack couldn’t say the date he said they had one and pointed out Samsung has two big announcements per year. The next one of those would be an autumn announcement when a new Galaxy Note is usually unveiled. No word on the PC version of the Oculus.</p>
<p>Cnet reports that <a href="http://www.cnet.com/au/news/instagram-gives-advertisers-more-ways-to-display-ads/">Instagram is expanding the types of ads it shows, introducing a &#8220;carousel&#8221; that allows advertisers to post a sequence of photos and a link to a website</a>. Instagram said the goal is to make it easier for users to interact with a brand. No word on actual Instagram users getting a carousel.</p>
<p>GigaOm reports a study from the <a href="https://gigaom.com/2015/03/04/affordability-report-shows-why-emerging-markets-need-smart-internet-policies/">Alliance for Affordable Internet shows that for more than two billion people, fixed-line broadband costs 40% of monthly income and mobile broadband 10%</a>. The UN affordability target is 5% of monthly income. Almost 60% of global households are unconnected. Women and the rural poor have the hardest time affording Internet. Costa Rica, Colombia and Peru received top marks for having solid affordable infrastructure rollout plans. Policy areas that need attention include competition-friendly environments and good spectrum allocation.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Patrick and I were wondering if former US Secretary of State Hilary Clinton was using AOL or Yahoo for her personal email account that she used while in officer. Turns out she was much smarter than that. <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/04/hillary-clinton-ran-her-own-email-server/?ncid=rss_truncated">Engadget reports the former Secretary of State ran her own email server while in office</a>. The Associated Press learned that Clinton used an email server registered to her home. It&#8217;s not clear where the server was or who ran it. If the server was in her house, she would have even had the Secret Service offering physical protection.</p>
<p>Mashable has a story up covering <a href="http://mashable.com/2015/03/03/uber-acquires-mapping-decarta/">Uber’s acquisition of mapping start-up deCarta.</a> deCarta focuses on location-based features, including mapping, local search and turn by turn navigation. 30 out of 40 deCarta employees will remain with Uber once the deal closes, including the CEO and President Kim Fennell. deCarta will continue to operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Uber, but will still use its own name. The mapping software will be used internally according to Uber.</p>

<p>Greeting Tom, Jennie and Jonathan:</p>
<p>I wanted to pass along a podcast that I have been listening to, <a href="%20http://www.starwarsminute.com/">The Star Wars Minute</a>. As of this email, they are on minute 33 of Return of the Jedi and it is the second most entertaining podcast I listen to. The premise of the show is that the host break down each original trilogy, one minute at a time. As a bonus they also did a couple of shows of the infamous Holiday Special.<br />
You can get the podcast at http://www.starwarsminute.com/</p>
<p>I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I have.</p>

<p>I’ve been thinking about Pebble doing another Kickstarter and the reason’s behind it. Certainly it’s an easy way to drum up media attention, and pays lip service to fans who want to feel some kind of “ownership” over the product’s success. But what if another reason is to give developers some raw sales numbers just prior to the Apple Watch launch. Pebble recently crowed that they’ve sold one million watches, now they can show that they can bump their marketshare substantially just on a presale announcement of a new product. As of today they’ve got pledges for about 75,000 Pebble Time products, that’s a 7.5% increase in user base in 7 days (probably less because of repeat buyers, but still impressive growth). Now instead of having to wait until the Apple Watch launch to start talking about how well the product sold, they can directly point to hard numbers of watches. While its hard to imagine the Apple Watch not being a sales success, the estimate of how many will sell is pretty variable, giving Pebble critical time now to make their case to developers as a growing viable platform. I think the people at Pebble are pulling a brilliant move to get customer and developer support prior to actually releasing their product – admittedly I type this with a Pebble on my wrist and I’m biased in this regard.</p>

<p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>I have enjoyed your discussions on the possible future for Smart Watches, and thought I would give my limited insights.</p>
<p>I bought a pebble that was reduced in last year’s black Friday sale, more out of curiosity than anything else. My wife was horrified when she saw me wearing it, as there is it certainly couldn’t be accused of being a thing of beauty.</p>
<p>There are some things it does really well:-<br />
(1) Allows me to have my phone on silent, and alerts me of calls with the caller id by a vibration on my wrist. You can reject calls with a press of a button which is great for the mountain of “caller unknown” spam calls I get.</p>
<p>(2) The notifications of new e-mail, text messages, or even CNN breaking news are nice to have, and again let me know if there is anything urgent I need to react to while I am not at my desk.</p>
<p>(3) Music / Podcast / &#8216;Economist audio&#8217; control. I am often out running with my phone in one of those arm cases. When I need to pause audio the pebble is just great.</p>
<p>(4) The Misfit step counter app is great, allowed me to replace my Nike Fuel Band (yes I can pick the winners!), nice to have sleep tracking too. An always on display with the time also showing is great – this Misfit screen is my default screen</p>
<p>(5) The battery life is not bad.</p>
<p>Some down sides:-<br />
(1) Almost all of the Apps are terrible – I installed a number of them and quickly found them useless. If I need to browse evernote a watch interface is not the way to do it. This is probably why Pebble are moving to the timeline approach.</p>
<p>(2) The build quality of the original pebble is a bit toy-like. I scratched the plastic screen early on, something I had never done with any other watch.</p>
<p>(3) The watch can disconnect from the phone, and suddenly stop sending notifications – this problem has improved with O/S patches.</p>
<p>(4) It is big and ugly.</p>
<p>I think the Apple Watch (or at least version 1) will struggle:-<br />
(1) A watch is for information you can get at a glance, I will be surprised if any killer apps that are more than glorified notifications emerge. (even maps on a watch seems limited use, especially as you need your phone with you)</p>
<p>(2) It might be made of high quality components, but it is not a thing of beauty (no matter how many pages Apple buy in Vogue).</p>
<p>(3) ApplePay (or NFC based tickets for something like the London Underground) might be nice, but not really a huge time saver to have them on your wrist as opposed to your phone.</p>
<p>(4) It is not cheap.</p>
<p>(5) If you are trying to monitor your steps and sleep patterns when will you charge it?</p>
<p>My my 2cents worth,</p>
<p>Simon</p>
<p>====</p>
<p>Hi Tom(and Patrick as he was there for the discussion),<br />
I just wanted to write in about the discussion on yesterday&#8217;s show about the whole treason/no treason issue. There is a very clear legal definition of treason(well actually a couple different levels), that while most people may or may not be aware of, all cleared US government employees and contractors have explained to them upon receiving their clearance. By that definition, Edward Snowden absolutely, positively committed treason. The real discussion should be is: &#8220;Was it justified?&#8221;, and/or perhaps, &#8220;what punishment if any is deserved?&#8221;<br />
The best analogy I can think of is Robin Hood vs Bonnie and Clyde. Both absolutely committed armed robbery, but we don&#8217;t say that Robin Hood didn&#8217;t commit armed robbery because we are happy with the results&#8230;<br />
Love the show.</p>
<p>Todd</p>

<p><strong>Philo1927</strong> sent us the news that <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/canadians-spocking-their-currency-in-tribute-to-leonard-nimoy/">Canadians have been &#8220;spocking&#8221; their currency to honor the late Leonard Nimoy</a>. Canada&#8217;s $5 bill features the 7th Canadian Prime Minister, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, who looks enough like Mr. Spock to make the transformation easy with a few pen strokes. The bank note is also a shade of blue that&#8217;s close to Spock&#8217;s uniform. Canadians have been spocking fives since at least 2008, but picked up again when Design resource tweeted encouragement for Spocking. When word got out to Canadian William Shatner, he said via Twitter, &#8220;&#8230;the defacing of the Canadian $5 bill warms my heart.&#8221; The Bank of Canada? Not as thrilled. stating that &#8220;Writing on a bank note may interfere with the security features and reduces its lifespan,&#8221; and &#8220;markings on a note may also prevent it from being accepted in a transaction.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Pick of the Day:<a href="https://justgetflux.com/"> F-Lux </a> via Eric from Lovely Cleveland</strong></p>
<p>First, Great Show. Been listen since BOL. Tom you do a wonderful Job, You ever think you might want to do it for a living?</p>
<p>A pick for you.. F-Lux. https://justgetflux.com/ It changes the computer’s monitor output from brightness to color output. Blue light segments are bad for sleeping and this changes the hue to remove it. The program also dims the screen at night to match your room. Being a dedicated IT guy I spend hours on my computer and at night. This helps saves my eyes.</p>
<p>I liked the show you did where you told everyone how you guys at DTN work. I think you should take this another step and show how other people work. I would even continue and go the next step and show how couples and households work together with technology.</p>
<p>Thank you to you and the other people who help. Jenny, Roger and so on.</p>
<p>Eric from Lovely Cleveland.</p>

<p><b>Show Notes</b></p>
<p><strong>Today&#8217;s guest: <a href="https://twitter.com/LamarrWilson">Lamarr Wilson</a>, host, showcaser, and internet personality at <a href="http://www.lamarrwilson.com/">lamarrwilson.com</a></strong></p>
<p><b style="line-height: 1.5;">Headlines:</b><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> </span></p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/02/google-sundar-pichai-mvno/?ncid=rss">Google’s Sundar Pichai dropped some announcement bombs at MWC</a>. Project Titan is about to be where Project Loon was a couple years ago, taking its first test steps. Titan delivers Internet by drone where Loon does it by balloon.</p>
<p><span id="more-3136"></span></p>
<p>In addition to continuing to experiment with balloons and drones for delivering data, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/2/8131145/googles-titan-drone-flight-internet-access">the company plans to launch an experimental mobile network in the US in the “coming months” as an MVNO</a>. The network will be rolled out in cooperation with unnamed mobile carrier partners and will combine WiFi and LTE for coverage. TechCrunch reports Pichai said the company does not intend to be a network operator at scale. Interesting sidenote. <a href="https://gigaom.com/2015/03/01/t-mobile-will-launch-lte-in-the-wi-fi-airwaves-in-2016/">T-Mobile also announced a combined WiFi and LTE network in the WiFI bands coming in 2016. </a></p>
<p>Pichai also said <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/02/pichai-magic-leap/?ncid=rss">he works closely with Magic Leap and used Google Translate as an example of something the mythical AR product can improve.</a></p>
<p>He also mentioned <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/02/android-pay-is-real-and-will-give-developers-the-reins-as-an-api/">Google Pay, a project to give app developers a consistent back-end to operate mobile payments in their apps</a>. Google would provide API access to a secure way to store payment info and tokenize card numbers for any app maker.  So consider it all a big Google I/O teaser trailer.</p>
<p>Not be outdone, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told the MWC audience that <a href="http://mashable.com/2015/03/02/mark-zuckerberg-mobile-world-congress-drones/">Facebook is still building drones, lasers and satellites of its own in order to spread Internet around the world as part of the Internet.org project</a>. According to Mashable, Zuck even said he love to do more in cooperation with Google on the project. Although he did downplay the lasers and satellites saying most of Internet.org will be delivered through more traditional means.</p>
<p>CNET noted that responding to a concern from Telenor Group CEO Jon Frederik Baksaas, <a href="https://gigaom.com/2015/03/02/zuckerbergs-internet-org-feels-the-love-and-fear-from-carriers/">Zuckerberg emphasized that apps like FB Messenger and WhatsAPP— which compete with carriers own messaging services — will not be included in Internet.org offerings</a>.</p>
<p>GigaOM reports Mario Zanotti, SVP of operations at Millicom said <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/zuckerberg-downplays-drones-balloons-for-delivering-net-access/#ftag=CAD590a51e">data users rose 30% in Paraguay and 10 times in Tanzania after rolling out Internet.org</a>.</p>
<p>Reuters reports <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2015/03/02/aruba-networks-m-a-hp-idINKBN0LY1FX20150302">HP says it will buy WiFi networking gear maker Aruba Networks for around $2.7 billion</a>. That would be HP’s biggest acquisition since it bought Autonomy Plc in 2011, an acquisition that did not go well. The acquistion would boost HP’s share of enterprise WLAN market from 4-5% by adding Aruba’s 10-13%. HP still plans to separate its compuert and printer business from its enterprise hardware and services business later this year.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reports <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/02/blackphone2-blackphone-plus/?ncid=rss">SGP Technologies announced the BlackPhone 2 at MWC</a>. The new security-focused phone has an all-glass front and rear, along with a 5.5-inch full HD display, 64-bit processor and more RAM. It goes on sale this summer. Silent Circle also showed of a prototype of an 8-inch tablet called Blackphone+ set for an autumn release. SGP also announced a tablet-based secure audio conferencing system called Silent Meeting.</p>
<p>Intel has <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/03/intel-atom-mwc/">announced a slate of new mobile processors from Mobile World Congress according to Wired</a>. <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/03/intel-unveils-its-next-mobile-maneuver-atom-x3-x5-and-x7/">The X3, is an inexpensive, entry-level System on a Chip with either a 3G or 4G LTE modem, bluetooth and x86 architecture</a>. The X5 and X7 are positioned as mid and high end chips and also the first 14nm System on a Chip designs for tablets. Both chips have double the graphics power of previous intel chips and support for features like RealSense 3D and TrueKey face recognition password authentication all without reducing battery life. <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/9026/intel-at-mwc-2015-sofia-rockchip-low-cost-integrated-lte-atom-renaming-and-14nm-cherry-trail">Intel also announced a new LTE advanced modem, the XMM 7360 with promises of more stable connections and download speeds of 450 Mbps via carrier aggregation</a>. Devices featuring the modem will appear in the 2nd half of the year. X3 devices will ship this quarter while quad-core 3G and LTe versions as well as X5 and X7 devices will come in the 2nd half of the year.</p>
<p>9to5 Mac reports <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2015/03/02/tim-cook-says-apple-watch-will-be-available-outside-u-s-in-april/">Apple CEO Tim Cook told Apple store employees in Berlin last week that the Apple Watch will launch in Germany in April</a>, the first indication the Watch would launch in multiple countries.</p>
<p>Gamasutra reports that<a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/237724/Unreal_Engine_4_is_now_freetodownload_for_everyone.php"> Unreal Engine 4 is now completely free to download for all</a>. Current subscribers to the rights to develop on the engine will receive a prorated refund for the current monthly charge. Anyone who ever had a subscription will receive a $30 credit of the Unreal Engine Marketplace. While development is now free royalties on sales of games that use the engine remain thes same. 5% on gross revenue of each project after the first $3,000 earned.</p>
<p>CNET reports <a href="http://www.cnet.com/products/alcatel-hero-2-plus/">Alcatel launched a reversible phone called the OneTouch Idol 3</a>— meaning you can hold it upside down and still talk on it— and a 6-inch Hero 2+ phablet for $299 both running Cyanogen OS.</p>
<p>Ars Technica reports despite Google&#8217;s frequent claims that Lollipop will come with encryption on by default, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/03/google-quietly-backs-away-from-encrypting-new-lollipop-devices-by-default/">this seems to apply only to Nexus devices</a>. The latest version of the Android Compatibility Definition document gives carriers an out by saying, “it is very strongly RECOMMENDED as we expect this to change to MUST in the future versions of Android.” So not quite yet for all phones. It’s suspected that performance issues may have caused Google to give way a bit this time around.</p>
<p>Ars Technica also notes that <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/03/os-x-10-10-3-beta-goes-public-bringing-the-new-photos-app-with-it/">OS X 10.10.3 beta is now public, bringing the new Photos app with it</a>. You can find out more at https://appleseed.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/</p>

<p><strong>Pick of the Day: <a href="http://theteatable.com/">The Tea Table</a> via Eric</strong></p>
<p>I know you have had a lot of coffee picks, so I thought I&#8217;d throw in one for the tea-lovers in the audience. I&#8217;ve been buying my loose-leaf tea from http://theteatable.com/ for a few years now, and I can&#8217;t recommend them highly enough. They have a great selection of teas&#8211; black, green, herbal, you name it&#8211; at great prices. They also have a pretty good selection of teapots and other accessories, including the Finum Brew Basket, which could be a pick in its own right. -=Eric</p>

<p>Engadget passes along that <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/02/27/google-reverses-blogger-porn-ban/?ncid=rss_truncated">Google won&#8217;t ban adult content posted to Blogger after all</a>. The company had announced that existing sexually explicit images and video would be made private and future such material might be deleted. Not anymore. Google cited &#8220;a ton of feedback&#8221; and the &#8220;negative impact on individuals who post sexually explicit content to express their identities.&#8221; Jessica Pelegio, Google&#8217;s social product support manager wrote in the Blogger Help Forum “we&#8217;ve decided to step up enforcement around our existing policy prohibiting commercial porn.&#8221; Google also called on blog owners to mark any blog pages with adult conent as &#8220;adult&#8221; so they can be placed behind a warning page.</p>

<p>The Daily Telegraph got to accompany Apple CEO Tim Cook on a surprise visit to the Apple Store in Covent Garden, London. While most of the article discusses known features of the forthcoming Apple Watch such as fitness tracking and Apple Pay, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/watch/11439847/Apple-Watch-will-replace-your-car-keys-says-Tim-Cook.html">it also mentioned that Cook said the watch could replace car keys</a>.

<p>TechCrunch reports that Google has unveiled plans for new headquarters in Mountain View, which will be a simple block of offices. Ha. KIDDING! <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/02/27/google-hq/?ncid=rss#TQUNqg:eGe">It&#8217;s going to be monstrous</a>. The new headquarters would be made of a semi-transparent series of canopies covering lightweight block structures that can be moved around as Google focuses on new products. This is the first time Google has designed and built new offices from scratch, and it partnered with Bjarke Ingels at BIG and Thomas Heatherwick at Heatherwick Studio to create the design. The nearly ten-minute video of the concept is best enjoyed with a tiny espresso and a masters in architecture.</p>

Well at least Apple ended a patent case Tuesday. OH wait! Smartflash LLC, which one $532.9 million Tuesday figured Apple’s too good a mark to let go. So S<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/27/us-ip-apple-lawsuit-idUSKBN0LU27X20150227">martflash is suing Apple for infringement of the same two patents</a> it one on Tuesday bit used in devices not covered int he previous case.</p>

<p><b>Show Notes</b></p>
<p><strong>Today&#8217;s guests: Justin Robert Young and Jon Strickland</strong></p>
<p><b style="line-height: 1.5;">Headlines:</b><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> </span></p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/02/26/fcc-passes-strict-net-neutrality-regulations-on-3-2-vote/?ncid=rss">The US FCC voted 3-2 to adopt an order for new Open Internet Rules</a>. Broadly the rules will enhance the existing transparency order and prevent blocking and discrimination under the authority of Title II of the Communications act of 1934. The new rules have not been made public. The FCC must receive and respond to dissenting statements from the commissioners who voted against the rules. Once that has happened the rules will be published in the Federal Register and will go into effect 60 days from the date of publication.</p>
<p><span id="more-3117"></span></p>
<p>The US FCC also voted<a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/02/fcc-overturns-state-laws-that-protect-isps-from-local-competition/"> 3-2 to preempt state laws to allow the City of Wilson, North Carolina and the Electric Power Board of Chattanooga, Tennessee </a>to expand their existing gigabit broadband service to nearby towns where speeds offered are not as fast.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reports that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/02/26/apple-sends-out-invites-for-march-9-event-likely-for-apple-watch/?ncid=rss">Apple sent out invites today for an event at 10am on Monday, March 9th with the tagline &#8220;spring forward.&#8221; </a>What in the world could they possibly be talking about on that day? Well Daylight Saving Time begins in the US on March 8, the day before the event so it could just be a really elaborate reminder to test smoke alarms and reset clocks. Or it could be the Apple Watch. And I guess it could also include MacBookAir or iPad updates to um, pad out the announcement.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reports<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/02/26/google-starts-testing-mobile-app-ads-in-the-google-play-store/?ncid=rss"> Google launched a pilot program to allow app developers to advertise their apps in the Google Play store</a>. Devs running Google search ads already can choose to have the ads also run against Play store searches. This would put their app at the top of the search result with a small ‘Ad’ button appearing under the App’s name. To start, the ads will begin running on the latest version of the Play store for a small number of smartphone users only.</p>
<p>ZDNet reports <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/docker-machine-swarm-compose-now-the-orchestration-tools-roll-out/">Docker’s orchestration services are now available to the public</a>. Compose 1.1 and beta version of Machine and Swarm are all available for download. Machine lets any laptop, server or VM run Docker apps, Swarm clusters multiple servers into a single machine and Compose makes it easier to build a complex distributed app from a number of containers. This marks the evolution of Docker from one-off containers into a full platform. Docker has more than 30 partners including AWS, Google, IBM, Microsoft and VMware.</p>
<p><a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/02/26/apples-ios-grabbed-a-record-88-7-of-smartphone-profits-in-q4-2014-android-fell-to-a-new-low-of-11-3/">VentureBeat passes along news from Strategy Analytics that Apple’s estimated global smartphone operating profit reached $18.8 billion last quarter up 31% year over year making up 88.7% of the market</a>. Android cashed in 4.8 billion for 11.3%. Careful mathematicians will note that adds to 100%. That means while Android dominates sales, Apple’s making all the money and no other platform is making squat.</p>
<p>Ars Technica reports on <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/02/researchers-unearth-evidence-of-superfish-style-attacks-in-the-wild/">a blog post on EFF.org indicating evidence of possible exploitations of the insecure certificates issued by Komodia as part of Superfish and other software</a>. Researchers Joseph Bonneau and Jeremy Gillula found more than 1600 entries in the Decentralized SSL observatory of certs that should have been rejected but were accepted by Komodia. Some of the certs might have been invalid due to routine issues but the researchers felt it was unlikely all of them were.</p>
<p><strong>News From You: </strong></p>
<p><strong>melchizedek74</strong> and <strong>KAPT_Kipper</strong> want us to know that if that Superfish news wasn’t enough of a headache for Lenovo, Engadget reports that<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/02/25/lenovo-com-hacked/"> Lenovo.com was hijacked to show pictures of kids at computers with a link to a Twitter account claiming to represent the group Lizard Squad</a>. In addition Ars Technica reports the DNS hijack was also able to intercept email before Cloudflare updated the MX records. Which basically means they took this hijack to the Max, Justin.</p>
<p><strong>HobbitfromPA</strong> wanted us to make sure we mentioned the DroidLife story that <a href="http://www.droid-life.com/2015/02/25/google-doubles-capacity-of-play-music-libraries-to-50k-songs/">Google Play Music has doubled its capacity from 25,000 songs to 50,000 all still at the low low price of nothing.</a></p>

<p><strong>Pick of the Day: <a href="http://hola.org/">Hola.org</a></strong><br />
Co-Executive Producer Biocow recommends hola.org. Hola is a browser plug-in that creates a VPN through dozens of countries.</p>
<p>Hola was simple to instal and very easy to use. It creates a button in the browser which when clicked opens a nice interface that lets you scroll through countries and displays a small flag of the country you&#8217;re browsing through.</p>
<p>I used this on a Mac using FireFox but their site says they have solutions for Mac and PC, FireFox and Chrome and even Androids, iPhone and iPad.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gemalto.com/press/Pages/Gemalto-presents-the-findings-of-its-investigations-into-the-alleged-hacking-of-SIM-card-encryption-keys.aspx">Gemalto issued a press release today stating it detected two sophisticated intrusions in 2010</a> that it now believes could have been an operation by the US NSA and UK GCHQ as described in leaks from Edward Snowden. Gemalto is the world’s largest supplier of SIM Cards for phones. One intrusion was an attempt to intercept communication by employees in a French office and another was a phishing attempt on a mobile operator. Gemalto detected no breaches in its SIM Card database and does not believe the breach of office networks could have resulted in massive theft of SIM encryption keys.</p>

<p>ReCode reports<a href="http://recode.net/2015/02/25/apple-ordered-to-pay-533-million-for-patent-infringement-in-itunes/"> The US District Court for the eastern district of Texas ordered Apple to pay $533 million dollars after being found guilty for patent infringement</a>. The jury found Apple willfully violated three Smartflash patents in iTunes related to DRM, storage and access through payment systems. Smartflash lodged the suit in May 2013 in Cupertino California but was held in Tyler Texas where Smartflash is based. <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-25/apple-told-by-jury-to-pay-532-9-million-in-gaming-patent-trial">Apple had asked the jury to find the suit invalid because previous patent inventions covered the same technology.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/2/25/8107079/motorola-new-moto-e-2nd-gen-lte-customizable-colors">Motorola&#8217;s new Moto E has LTE and a bigger screen for $149</a> The second-gen Moto E has a 4.5-inch (but still 540 x 960 pixel) display, 4G LTE networking, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 processor. The removable backplate has been replaced by six colored bands that can be used to personalize the device. Other upgrades include a new 5-megapixel camera withautofocus, 8GB of internal storage, up from 4, and Android 5.0 Lollipop. Motorola also added its Quick Capture feature, which lets you launch the camera with just a twist of your wrist and the Active Display feature that wakes the screen up with notifications or when you pull it out of your pocket.</p>
<p>ZDNet reports <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/android-for-work-update-google/">Google unveiled an Android for Work program Wednesday which can establish work profiles on mobile devices</a>. The program lets sys admins manage approved apps on the profiles and set up default encryption on Android 5.0 Lollipop devices. Employers can only manage work data and do not see personal data. Likewise users can add and remove apps at will on the personal side. Google is partnering with enterprise management firms to deliver the program, including Cisco, Salesforce, BOX and SAP among others.</p>
<p>Threatpost reports <a href="http://threatpost.com/google-pwnium-program-now-open-all-year/111251">Google is making its bug-finding contest Pwnium a never-ending affair</a>. Bug-hunters no longer need to wait for a security conference to cash in. Security researchers can submit bugs found in Chroium year round and Google will not place a limit on the number they will reward with cash money. In fact Tim Willis of the Chrome security team said the rewards pool “goes all the way up to infinity million dollars.” The bugs just have to meet the same criteria they always did. And winners have disclose all the details of the vulnerability along with the exploit.</p>
<p>Deep Q-network or DQN <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2015/02/ai-masters-49-atari-2600-games-without-instructions/">a product of Google’s DeepMind artificial intelligence program has successfully mastered 49 Atari 2600 games according to Ars Technica</a>. Unlike previous AI game masters where information like rules for playing chess or trivia information was pre-loaded into the system, DQN taught itself how to play the games and win. Researchers modeled DQN’s AI on a trial-and-error behavior similar to humans and animals, and developed a process called “deep reinforcement learning”. By “remembering” past outcomes and its associated actions DQN was able to score about 75% of the points of a human game player. Games DQN successfully mastered include Breakout and space invaders but it failed at Ms Pac-Man and similar games that required planning and foresight.</p>
<p>CNET passes along the South Korean daily Donga News’ report that <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/amazon-could-be-landing-in-south-korea-soon/">Amazon may open branch offices in Seou’s Gangnam area as early as next month.</a> Amazon’s US carerres website lists several positions in Seoul and first-round interviews for 300 positions reportedly took place over the last week. That’s a challenge to local ecommerce heavyweights eBay Korea and Gmarket. At least it’s not Alibaba’s Tmall… Yet.</p>
<p><strong>News From You: </strong></p>
<p><strong>KAPT_Kipper</strong> sent us the news that <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/the-eiffel-tower-now-generates-its-own-power-with-new-wind-turbines/">the Eiffel Tower now generates its own power with new wind turbines</a>. CNET reports that a pair of VisionAIR5 wind turbines designed by renewable energy specialist Urban Green Energy have been installed on the second level, about 122 meters or 400ft from the ground. The turbines have been painted to blend in with the Eiffel tower, and produce almost no sound. They can produce, a total of 10,000kWh per year &#8212; enough to power the tower&#8217;s first floor. The tower will also soon get LED lighting, solar panels, a rainwater collection system and high-power heat pumps. Not bad, giant iron tower built in 1889, not bad at all.</p>
<p><strong>AllanAv</strong> submitted the Tom&#8217;s Hardware exclusive that A “source with knowledge of the matter” says <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/news/microsoft-directx12-amd-nvidia,28606.html">the DirectX 12 will work much differently than older versions</a>. For one the API will combine all graphic resources in one bucket and let devs divide up the workload as they wish. The upshot is reduced latency by reducing the frame queue to one or zero. The source also indicated that DirectX12 could work across multiple GPU architectures at once. Meaning you could build a system with a Geforce and Radeon working in tandem or even aggregating APUs with GPUs.</p>
<p><strong>mranthropology</strong> passed along a Windows Central report that <a href="http://m.windowscentral.com/microsoft-removing-google-chat-and-facebook-chat-support-outlookcom">Microsoft will remove Google Chat and Facebook Chat support from Outlook.com in the next couple weeks</a>. The People page in Outlook will stay updated with the latest contact information from Facebook and Google if you&#8217;ve connected them. Microsoft blames Google for discontinuing its Google Talk chat protocol. No word on why Facebook is getting the boot.</p>

<p>Pick of the Day: http://testmy.net/</p>
<p>Bill Russell writes: “I wanted to throw in another ISP speed test. TestMy.Net is a great alternative that I&#8217;ve been using since I read about the possibility that ISPs were prioritizing their packets to boost the numbers. TestMy.Net randomly generates the data that is sent so ISPs can&#8217;t even cache the data to deceive the meter.</p>
<p>One thing I really like about TestMy.Net is the ability to run repeated tests. You can set it to run once every 5 minutes for 100 repeated tests or every 24 hours for only 5 tests. This recently helped out a coworker that had a 60Mbps connection that was being slowed down every night around 11pm to the point that he couldn&#8217;t watch Netflix or play online games(less than 500kbps). He used TestMy.Net to show his ISP exactly when and how often this was happening and within a few weeks the ISP replaced hardware and now he&#8217;s getting his 60Mbps and sometimes more.”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/2/24/8100565/pebble-time-kickstarter-goal">Pebble launched a new watch called Pebble Time on Kickstarter this morning raising $1 million in 49 minutes, the fastest Kickstarter project to get to a million ever</a>. The watch features a color e-ink screen, a microphone and a new interface called Timeline that shows information in chronological order rather than in an app interface. Kickstarter backers get a discount and should start receiving watches in May. The rest will pay $199 at retail a few months later.</p>

The ultimate goal is to sell the technology to carriers. To that end, Artemis will sell the Artemis I Hub to let carriers test pCells in their own networks. Artemis is also releasing a detailed white paper this week to answer questions about how it has made the tech work. For San Francisco’s test, Artemis needs core infrastructure an MVNO agreement and FCC approval to be able to sell SIM cards by Fall.</p>

<p>The Verge passes along The Hill report that FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn would like to see some adjustments made to Comissioner Wheeler’s proposal for Open Internet Rules.

<p><strong>News From You: </strong></p>
<p><strong>djsekani</strong> sent us this story from USA today about <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/02/22/cellphone-911-lack-location-data/23570499/">the US&#8217;s 9-1-1 emergency network&#8217;s problem reliably locating calls that come from cell phone</a>. According to the story 911’s chance of getting a fix on your location ranges as low as 10% to as high as 95%. The FCC is working in conjunction with the 4 largest cellphone carriers to address the issue including new rules for carriers to transmit location data, with deadlines for delivery of location data for 40% of cellphone calls by 2017 and 80% by 2021. The problem is that the 911 system relies on the carrier to locate the phone while apps like Google and Facebook use a phone&#8217;s GPS.</p>

Google’s Director of Project Management, Alex Gawley, said the Inbox for Work experience will be indistinguishable from the consumer version. Google Apps for Work sys admins can request an invite by emailing inboxforwork@google.com. Invites should start arriving next month.</p>
<p>Ars Technica reports <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/02/fcc-republicans-launch-last-ditch-effort-to-sink-net-neutrality-plan/">two US FCC commissioners, Ajit Pai and Michael O’Reilly have requested the commission delay its vote on Open Internet Rules for 30 days and make the entire proposal available for public review</a>. The FCC usually does not release final drafts of rules publicly to reduce lobbying. Exceptions have been made in the past such as in the case of a change in rules on media ownership in 2003. The FCC is scheduled to vote on the new rules Thursday and DTNS is preparing a special roundtable discussion for Friday’s show.</p>

<p><strong>habichuelacondulce</strong> submitted the PC World article that<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2887392/lenovo-hit-with-lawsuit-over-superfish-snafu.html"> a class action lawsuit has been filed against Lenovo in the US District Court for the Southern District. of California</a>. Plaintiff Jessica Bennett, on behalf of the class, complained her laptop was damaged, her privacy invaed, her computer performance degraded and her bandwidth used by Superfish. Lenovo issued a fix to remove Superfish and its compromised certificate from all browsers on affected Lenovo computers. Meanwhile the Komodia software used by Superfish to intercept HTTPS traffic has been disovered in several other programs.</p>
<p><strong>MacBytes</strong> wanted to let us know about another announcement from last week&#8217;s annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in San Jose. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-31467619">The BBC reports on a project to scan the Amazon Forest in Brazil, using a drone equipped with LIDAR or Laser Illuminated Detection And Ranging&#8211; to peer through the thick forest canopy</a>. The project hopes to locate geoglyphs or large geometric patterns in the ground. More than 450 geoglyphs have been found in places where the forest has been cut down. The project could help answer questions about the size and complexity of Amazonian civilization prior to european contact.</p>

Pick of the Day:  Hindenburg via Anders</strong></p>
<p>My good friend and former coworker, Nick Dunkerley, has developed an excellent audio editing tool specifically for radio and podcast work. It&#8217;s called Hindenburg, and I use it almost every day &#8211; It has filtering and compression and that sort of thing, it can record Skype conversations (in separate tracks), etc. has lots of keyboard shortcuts and can be picked up in a few minutes</p>
<p><a href="http://hindenburg.com">http://hindenburg.com</a></p>
<p>Anyway, as mentioned in full disclosure, I know Nick and the others behind the company, I was the first alpha tester and have remained in frequent touch with them for feedback, input and feature requests.</p>
<p>The name, I should say, comes of course from the (in-)famous radio piece from the airship disaster &#8211; I&#8217;ve always thought it was slightly morbid, but hey&#8230;</p>
<p>Cheers, and keep up the good work,<br />
Anders</p>
<p><strong>And<a href="http://simplenote.com/"> Simplenote</a> via Peter Wells</strong></p>
<p>and a very quick pick from me, you mentioned iftt&#8217;s new Do Camera last week on the show, and it has already made it to my home screen. Why? Well I&#8217;m very frustrated with Evernote, I much prefer the speed and simplicity of Simplenote- but I always wanted a way to take quick picks of serial numbers, receipts, etc for work, without those photos clogging up my camera roll. Do Camera allows me to do just that! You can turn off &#8220;Save to Camera Roll&#8221; in settings, then take those little &#8220;important for a few minutes&#8221; photos on your phone, and know they&#8217;ll immediately be uploaded to Dropbox or your preferred cloud service.</p>

In an editorial about the future of the US’s role in ICANN he says that with the Department of Commerce ICANN contract ending in Sept, oversight of ICANN will be completely handed over to the international community by the end of the year. ICANN’s next planning session happens this June in Buenos Aires, Argentina.</p>
<p>The Next Web reports that <a href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2015/02/20/23andme-passed-big-regulatory-hurdle-getting-back-market/">the US FDA has cleared genetics testing company 23 and me to market one of their genetic tests</a>. Back in 2013, the FDA asked 23 and Me to stop selling their DNA tests because they had not been reviewed and could lead to inappropriate treatments. The company is now approved to test whether a person is a carrier for Bloom syndrome, an inherited disorder characterized by short stature, sun-sensitive skin changes, and an increased risk of cancer.</p>
<p><strong>News From You: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Hurmoth</strong> sent us the Ars Technica report that <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/02/time-warner-cable-calls-customer-ct-after-she-reports-cable-box-problem/">Esperanza Martinez of Orange County California received a letter about canceling her Time Warner service</a>, a letter that replaced her first name with a derogatory slang word beginning with the letter c. And Martinez never actually canceled her service. After the company was contacted by Ars Technica, Martinez received an apology and a free year of service. Time Warner blamed the issue on a third party vendor, and said they are changing their processes to prevent this from happening again. A timeline for the services? My guess is they&#8217;ll See You Next Tuesday</p>
<p><strong>the_corley</strong> sent us a news story from RDMag.com <a href="http://www.rdmag.com/news/2015/02/tool-helps-boost-wireless-channel-frequencies-capacity">revealing the National Institutes of Standards and Technology’s role in developing new tools to measure higher frequencies planned for next generation mobile communication technology like 5G</a>. As devices reach millimeter wavelength frequencies above 10GHz, the tools to reliably and accurately measure them are incomplete. These toosl are needed to prevent interference and errors in transmission. So far NIST has produced a calibrated modulated signal source to test millimeter wave instruments and a new probe to measure electric fields operating over a 100GHz.</p>

<p>As I wright this we have a category 5 cyclone bearing down on us. A site that many Australians may have heard of but not known how useful it is in the event of bad weather is <a href="bom.gov.au">bom.gov.au</a>. Yes the good ol’ Bureau of Meteorology or just The Bom as us young’ins call it. It has rain radar, weather charts, satellite images, forecast, historical data, flood information, tropical cyclone information just to name a handful of features and is super useful in times of natural disaster. So if your in Australia and have some weather related event you want to know more about check out The Bom at bom.gov.au.</p>
