On this week's All Songs Considered, hosts Bob Boilen and Robin Hilton are joined by NPR Music's Stephen Thompson and NPR contributor Katie Presley to share some of the early discoveries they're most excited to see and hear, from the comical Canadian punk band Needs and English rapper Little Simz to Icelandic singer-songwriter Kaleo and the sparkling twee-pop group Kero Kero Bonito.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"duration";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"4941";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"explicit";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3:"yes";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:82:"

You can hear songs by ten of his favorite discoveries from the New York-based festival here. Four of those songs are on the show this week, including an upbeat but dark song from the British trio Happyness, a grinding track from post-punk band Protomartyr, Japanese prog and punk rock from Bo Ningen and gorgeous vocals and instrumental harmonies from teenage Norwegian singer-songwriter Aurora.</p><p>Robin also shares a gorgeous, spare song from Grouper (Liz Harris), whose forthcoming album, Ruins, is available to stream in its entirety in our First Listen series.

In a long conversation that touches on his work with some of the musicians listed above, Congleton shared his own mantra as a producer and listener, which was inspired by the example of one of his heroes, the late, great BBC radio DJ, music journalist and taste maker John Peel: "Any time he ever hears a piece of music that he doesn't like, he just assumes it's his problem." It's a great philosophy that takes music listening and criticism beyond the judgmental, number-driven rating system that often defines it.

Later in the show, Bob shares GOAT's "Hide From The Sun" before Robin plays new music from the full-throttle, jangly, punk rock trio Spider Bags. Bob closes out the show with Zola Jesus' "Dangerous Days," a high-powered dance-rock tune that gives him the energy needed to pick up his suitcase and get home for some much-needed sleep.

Also on the show: The hardcore band F—-ed Up returns with a nerve-rattling new album that reflects on family, aging and the responsibilities of adulthood; country-folk singer Jessica Lea Mayfield goes electric on a cut from her new rock-inspired album Make My Head Sing; The group Young Fathers, with members from Scotland, Nigeria and Liberia, mix hip-hop, rock and electronics for a surprising sound; and singer Haley Bonar is back with a new collection of wondrously ornate pop.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"duration";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"2172";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"explicit";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3:"yes";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:56;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:82:"

Everyone had such a swell time at the musical blitzkrieg that they came down with colds. Their respective illnesses cannot dampen the colorful and illuminating memories that they made at SXSW 2014.</p><p>For Bob, the band that blew him out of the water was a British jazz-punk group called Melt Yourself Down.

Stephen was surprised by the passion, force and energy from an instrumental, electronic group, Anamanaguchi.</p><p>As much scheduling that goes into SXSW, our hosts often find that the best shows spread through word of mouth. So, they listened to recommendations and stumbled upon some fantastic gems. The airy soloist Vancouver Sleep Clinic was a notable gem, along with the Korean rock group Jambinai.

That's true of most pop singers, whose words often come out sounding more American than anything else. But that's not true with Cate Le Bon. Her phrasing is completely tied to her Welsh dialect &#8212; in fact, her first record was in Welsh. I find that that draws me into her songs: The enunciation is completely tied to the loneliness and the questioning. One song she sings at the Tiny Desk, from her brilliant album Mug Museum, is called "Are You With Me Now?"</p><p>There is a feeling I love</p><p>Buried in my brow</p><p>I have no reason to run</p><p>I see no reason</p><p>Are you with me now?</p><p>Listen to the inflection in the line 'Buried in my brow,' and then when she poses the question; it's so intimate, such a whisper, so inviting. I'm also a fan of her clean, sharp guitar playing and the way she weaves it together with her partner H. Hawkline.

It was also recorded by the same group of musicians, including drummer Joey Waronker (Atoms For Peace, R.E.M.), guitarist Jason Falkner and keyboardist Robert Joseph Manning, Jr. Beck's father, composer David Richard Campbell, is back as well, providing string arrangements &#8212; which you can hear some of in the song "Waking Light," premiered here.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"duration";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"2740";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"explicit";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2:"no";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:75;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:82:"

Teased late last year in a series of cryptic status updates, the forthcoming self-titled album from St. Vincent is one of the most anticipated of 2014. In a conversation with All Songs Considered hosts Bob Boilen and Robin Hilton, singer and guitarist Annie Clark gets into the stories behind the new record, due out Feb. 25. Though her look on the cover suggests an evil overlord, Clark says but the songs on St. Vincent were born in vulnerable moments —a chemical-induced hallucination starring a dead civil rights activist, and a standoff with a snake in which she literally couldn't have been more exposed, just to name a few.

Adam Goldberg, the actor and musician known for his role (among others) in the 1993 movie Dazed And Confused.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"duration";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"2417";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"explicit";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2:"no";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:100;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:82:"

Weed Album: Deserve Song: Silent Partner "I love the way the vocals are mixed behind the guitars; it gives it this really dreamy quality," says Robin Hilton of this fuzz-filled Vancouver four piece, which is currently readying its debut album, Deserve.

This track's gorgeous vocal hooks and retro production remind us of the band's breakthrough single "Go Outside" and we're excited to see how the album develops its classic sound. The Avett Brothers Album: Magpie And The Dandelion Song: Another Is Waiting "Recorded close to the same time as their last album The Carpenter, Magpie And The Dandelion is in a similar vein," says Stephen Thompson of the soon-to-be-released album by The Avett Brothers.

There's also new music from folk duo The Civil Wars, which finished its new album just before going on hiatus, and pianist singer Lucy Schwartz. NPR's Sami Yenigun plays a song by Moderat, the electronic group featuring the ambient sounds of Apparat and dance beats of Modeselektor, that amazed him so much he couldn't sleep.

Typhoon Album: White Lighter Song: Young Fathers While the subject matter can sometimes be bleak — it's often inspired by songwriter Kyle Morton's health struggles as a child — Typhoon's music is always beautiful and uplifting. This Portland, Oregon band that sometimes includes up to 17 people is set to release their second full length album White Lighter on August 20th. Sebadoh Album: Defend Yourself Song: I Will The All Songs team has spent a lot of time this year talking about big comebacks from '90s artists and, more importantly, how all these releases have lived up to the hype. Now, after a fourteen year hiatus, Sebadoh returns with Defend Yourself, out September 19th. Our own First Listen series will feature the album a week before it's release. Moderat Album: II Song: This Time Moderat is collaboration between electronic dance music group Modeselektor and dark electronic pop artist Apparat. NPR's Sami Yenigun said of "This Time": "I put it on to unwind after DJing. I like to calm down after the adrenaline of a show — this record did the opposite. I was wired after hearing it." F**k Buttons Album: Slow Focus Song: Red Wing NPR Music's Jacob Ganz says the music of this electronic production duo with epic rock leanings is motivational: "I spent a lot of time as an editor reading copy and when this is on I feel like a superhero." Archers of Loaf Album: Icky Mettle Song: Wrong Brought in to discuss the ongoing feud over mix-tape etiquette that has been chronicled here and here in his advice column, The Good Listener, NPR Music's Stephen Thompson declared that Robin Hilton — who argues that one mix-tape deserves another — is in fact wrong, and picked this song for him: "You are wrong, I dedicate this song to you, Robin Hilton. This is the Robin Hilton song." The Civil Wars Album: The Civil Wars Song: Dust To Dust Bob Boilen on the latest song from the now-on-a-break folk duo The Civil Wars, whose self-titled second album will be out on August 6: "What I like most in this song is also the thing this pair of musicians does best, what Johnny Cash and June Carter did best: a conversation, a duet between two people with underpinnings of tension that add to and even confuse the meaning of the song."

Sitting in NPR Music's New York studios, Bob previews a cinematic and seductive new record from The National, along with a new album from trip-hop veteran Tricky.

We also hear an "amazing piece of dramatic, freaky music" from Tom Jones, and a contemporary cut from Beach House that's one of Coyne's current favorites. The Flaming Lips consistently push the creative boundaries of music without making any apologies, and the band has been doing it for 30 years, with thirteen studio albums and countless other projects, including a completely re-imagined version of Pink Floyd's Dark Side Of The Moon. The Flaming Lips' latest, and highly anticipated upcoming album, is called The Terror, which you can now hear in its entirety on NPR's First Listen series, before it's released on April 16th.

The point of contention? John Denver. The late country singer, who provided the soundtrack to Robin's childhood, is celebrated on a new record called The Music Is You: A Tribute To John Denver. It features, among many other cuts and artists, My Morning Jacket doing "Leaving On A Jet Plane." We've also got a brand new song from David Bowie, from his first album of new songs in a decade. The French pop group Phoenix also returns with the band's first new song since 2009, called "Entertainment!" Plus Mwahaha, one of Bob's favorite discoveries from last year's South By Southwest music festival; the D.C. rock group Deathfix, featuring Brendan Canty of Fugazi; and Lone Bellow, a new-folk trio with amazing harmonies.

This year's lineup included Zimbabwe legend Oliver Mtukudzi and his band The Black Spirits, Malian singer Fatoumata Diawara, Chicago's wildly exuberant marching band Mucca Pazza, and much, much more. For this week's edition of All Songs Considered, NPR Music's Anastasia Tsioulcas, NPR contributor and Afropop.org senior editor Banning Eyre, and Rob Weisberg of WNYC (who also hosts WFMU'sTranspacific Sound Paradise) join Bob Boilen to revisit some of the highlights and favorite discoveries from this year's globalFEST. Oliver Mtukudzi and The Black Spirits GlobalFEST is generally a place to discover young new talent, but occasionally the producers welcome familiar friends to their party. This year, it was Zimbabwe's Oliver "Tuku" Mtukudzi, who has been an African musical icon since the late 1970s, who brought that sense of homecoming to GlobalFEST with his band, the Black Spirits. Kayhan Kalhor And Erdal Erzincan The soulful Persian classical virtuoso and composer Kayhan Kalhor has long been interested in creating artistic bridges to other musicians and styles. At this year's edition of globalFEST, he revived a partnership that initially began about a decade ago with a Turkish master artist, the baglama player Erdal Erzincan. La Santa Cecilia Based in Los Angeles and fronted by the smoky-voiced Marisol Hernandez, this fast-rising band splices and dices an array of Mexican and South American sounds in their songs, from Mexican norteño and ranchera to Colombian cumbia. Christine Salem As the globalFEST evening wound down, much of the buzz about who was the biggest find of the year centered around a seemingly unlikely figure: the vocalist Christine Salem, who made her New York City debut in this performance. Fatoumata Diawara Undoubtedly one of the breakout stars of this year's edition of globalFEST, the Malian singer Fatoumata Diawara had the crowd wrapped around her finger. Gifted with enormous stage presence and great looks, Diawara put on a tightly choreographed set that screamed with energy and edged towards rock and funk. Mucca Pazza The circus came to globalFEST in the form of Chicago's Mucca Pazza, a group of 30 clowns who could barely be contained in the cavernous ballroom at Webster Hall. They wore mismatched, thrift-shop marching band getups and sported a full range of brass, drums, violin, accordion and electric guitar — plus a gaggle of nerdy cheerleaders. A Tribe Called Red The night ended with bumping beats down at Webster Hall's Studio space with the Ottowa-based Native collective called A Tribe Called Red. They call their style "pow wow step": an imaginative and dance floor-ready blend of beats, aboriginal singing and dancing, and visuals and audio samples that turn "Indian" stereotypes on their heads.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 16 Jan 2013 19:01:21 -0500";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:9:"copyright";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"Copyright 2011 NPR - For Personal Use Only.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:91:"http://podcastdownload.npr.org/anon.npr-podcasts/podcast/510019/169555104/npr_169555104.mp3";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:9:"enclosure";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:127:"http://podcastdownload.npr.org/anon.npr-podcasts/podcast/510019/169555104/npr_169555104.mp3?orgId=1&e=169555104&ft=pod&f=510019";s:6:"length";s:1:"0";s:4:"type";s:10:"audio/mpeg";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:42:"http://www.itunes.com/dtds/podcast-1.0.dtd";a:4:{s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3:"NPR";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"summary";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3019:"Every January for the past decade a dozen or more bands from around the world have gathered in New York City for globalFEST - one long, frenzied night of live music showcasing the diverse cultures, histories and numerous sonic branches of "World Music."

La Santa Cecilia Based in Los Angeles and fronted by the smoky-voiced Marisol Hernandez, this fast-rising band splices and dices an array of Mexican and South American sounds in their songs, from Mexican norteño and ranchera to Colombian cumbia. Christine Salem As the globalFEST evening wound down, much of the buzz about who was the biggest find of the year centered around a seemingly unlikely figure: the vocalist Christine Salem, who made her New York City debut in this performance. Fatoumata Diawara Undoubtedly one of the breakout stars of this year's edition of globalFEST, the Malian singer Fatoumata Diawara had the crowd wrapped around her finger. Gifted with enormous stage presence and great looks, Diawara put on a tightly choreographed set that screamed with energy and edged towards rock and funk. Mucca Pazza The circus came to globalFEST in the form of Chicago's Mucca Pazza, a group of 30 clowns who could barely be contained in the cavernous ballroom at Webster Hall. They wore mismatched, thrift-shop marching band getups and sported a full range of brass, drums, violin, accordion and electric guitar — plus a gaggle of nerdy cheerleaders. A Tribe Called Red The night ended with bumping beats down at Webster Hall's Studio space with the Ottowa-based Native collective called A Tribe Called Red. They call their style "pow wow step": an imaginative and dance floor-ready blend of beats, aboriginal singing and dancing, and visuals and audio samples that turn "Indian" stereotypes on their heads.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"subtitle";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3019:"Every January for the past decade a dozen or more bands from around the world have gathered in New York City for globalFEST - one long, frenzied night of live music showcasing the diverse cultures, histories and numerous sonic branches of "World Music." This year's lineup included Zimbabwe legend Oliver Mtukudzi and his band The Black Spirits, Malian singer Fatoumata Diawara, Chicago's wildly exuberant marching band Mucca Pazza, and much, much more. For this week's edition of All Songs Considered, NPR Music's Anastasia Tsioulcas, NPR contributor and Afropop.org senior editor Banning Eyre, and Rob Weisberg of WNYC (who also hosts WFMU'sTranspacific Sound Paradise) join Bob Boilen to revisit some of the highlights and favorite discoveries from this year's globalFEST. Oliver Mtukudzi and The Black Spirits GlobalFEST is generally a place to discover young new talent, but occasionally the producers welcome familiar friends to their party. This year, it was Zimbabwe's Oliver "Tuku" Mtukudzi, who has been an African musical icon since the late 1970s, who brought that sense of homecoming to GlobalFEST with his band, the Black Spirits.

As the inventor of the Moog synthesizer, he gave rise to not only the technology needed for modern electronic music, but also the creative spirit that inspired countless musicians to take his vision and play with it, mold it and reshape it into mind-blowing works of art. This past weekend, a remarkably gifted group of electronic and experimental rock artists gathered in Asheville, N.C., for the annual Moogfest. All Songs Considered host Bob Boilen and NPR electronic and dance-music contributor Sami Yenigun were there and, on this week's show, discuss some of their favorite sets, including a special performance from electronic-music pioneer Morton Subotnick, Andy Stott, DJ legends Carl Craig and Richie Hawtin, along with Ana Sia, Squarepusher, Exitmusic and more. Morton Subotnick Subotnick released the first all-electronic album, Silver Apples of the Moon, in 1967. Last Friday, he returned to Moogfest 2012 in Asheville, N.C., to perform the whole thing live. Hear the performance in its entirety. Andy Stott Stott is known for deep, brooding techno tracks that are shrouded in fuzzy tones. Hailing from Manchester, U.K., the producer has released music both under his own name and as Andrea. Blondes This is the official video for the Blondes song "Wine" from the band's self-titled full-length debut. Ana Sia Ana Sia produces high-energy bass music set to hip-hop rhythms. Born in Minnesota, Sia saw her DJing career take off while in San Francisco, where her mix of low-end-heavy styles earned her a reputation for slaying the dance floor. Appropriately, her nickname is "Princess Slay-ah." Death Grips Watch Death Grips perform at the CMJ Music Marathon via NPR Music and WNYC. This group from Sacramento, Calif., has given some of the most memorable live performances of any act this year, with bass-heavy beats and intensely physical theatrics. Squarepusher Note: Squarepusher's set at Moogfest 2012 was not among the shows NPR Music recorded. This track is "303 Scopem Hard" from Squarepusher's 2012 album Ufabulum, via KCRW. Richie Hawtin Hear Richie Hawtin's full performance at Moogfest 2012. Hawtin came up in the Detroit techno scene during the '90s, and built his reputation on a minimal style of dance music. It's not music for everyone, but those who follow any of Hawtin's numerous aliases do show with impassioned vigilance. Carl Craig This cut is "Sketches, Pt. 4" from Carl Craig's 2012 EP Last Decade, released under the alias Carls Davis. Disclosure Hear Disclosure's full performance at Moogfest 2012. Brothers Guy and Howard Lawrence grew up on the outskirts of London, and got their start in the U.K. garage scene making music as Disclosure. Ahleuchatistas This song is "Mistaken Identity" from the 2011 Ahleuchatistas album Location Location. Tim Hecker & Daniel Lopatin The song featured here is "Uptown Psychedelia" from Tim Hecker and Daniel Lopatin's album Instrumental Tourist, due out in November 2012.

As the inventor of the Moog synthesizer, he gave rise to not only the technology needed for modern electronic music, but also the creative spirit that inspired countless musicians to take his vision and play with it, mold it and reshape it into mind-blowing works of art. This past weekend, a remarkably gifted group of electronic and experimental rock artists gathered in Asheville, N.C., for the annual Moogfest. All Songs Considered host Bob Boilen and NPR electronic and dance-music contributor Sami Yenigun were there and, on this week's show, discuss some of their favorite sets, including a special performance from electronic-music pioneer Morton Subotnick, Andy Stott, DJ legends Carl Craig and Richie Hawtin, along with Ana Sia, Squarepusher, Exitmusic and more. Morton Subotnick Subotnick released the first all-electronic album, Silver Apples of the Moon, in 1967. Last Friday, he returned to Moogfest 2012 in Asheville, N.C., to perform the whole thing live. Hear the performance in its entirety. Andy Stott Stott is known for deep, brooding techno tracks that are shrouded in fuzzy tones. Hailing from Manchester, U.K., the producer has released music both under his own name and as Andrea. Blondes This is the official video for the Blondes song "Wine" from the band's self-titled full-length debut. Ana Sia Ana Sia produces high-energy bass music set to hip-hop rhythms. Born in Minnesota, Sia saw her DJing career take off while in San Francisco, where her mix of low-end-heavy styles earned her a reputation for slaying the dance floor.

A founding member of experimental rock pioneers The Velvet Underground, Cale has spent nearly a half-century as an vanguard musician in drone, rock, and classical. He's known in part for producing seminal works by other artists, such as The Stooges, Patti Smith, and The Modern Lovers. But Cale has also had a prolific solo career.

The forthcoming album from Taken By Trees, the solo project of Victoria Bergsman, was inspired by a recent trip to Hawaii. Premiering here, "Dreams" is a tropical, slightly sultry song. Also inspired by landscapes, Son Lux (also known as Ryan Lott) created the song "Resound" for a compilation album of musical vignettes inspired by the remote countryside of Iceland. Lott used samples of My Brightest Diamond vocalist Shara Worden's voice and the sound of a piano shattered by a baseball bat to create an ethereal song. Also on the show, Bob Boilen schools Robin Hilton on their bet from last week by twisting the numbers a bit, but the search for the Albums Everyone Can Love is far from over.

Lott used samples of My Brightest Diamond vocalist Shara Worden's voice and the sound of a piano shattered by a baseball bat to create an ethereal song.

Vote For The Albums Everyone Can Love This discovery got us thinking: Is it possible to form a top ten list of records everyone can agree on? The kinds of records that, if you put them on at a party, everyone would say, "turn it up!" So we need you to vote. We've started by nominating 20 albums that we think will be loved by everyone who listens to them, and we want you to tell us whether YOU feel that love. To keep this running through the summer, we'll need more suggestions for albums that might fit the bill. Keep voting, and by August we hope to have a final list we can agree on. A big quest like this one needs a big kickoff, so for this week's show Bob and Robin play a few selections they and the rest of the NPR Music team think everyone will love. Bob and Robin are also joined by folk singer Glen Hansard, who throws Bob Marley's Exodus into the ring. We don't even scratch the surface of the surface with this show. But we hope to get the discussion going by fitting in as much in as possible, from quiet, emotional folk, and psychedelic funk, to high-strutting, head-banging rock.

On her 2009 breakthrough Because I Was in Love, Sharon Van Etten is the embodiment of exposed nerves; the very essence of wounded vulnerability. In that record's best song, "Much More Than That," she lays out her insecurities while laying herself bare: Adorned by little more than a chorus of her own looped voice, Van Etten tentatively recalls tiny romantic gestures as a way of expressing the inexpressible. "One day I'll be a better writer," she sings at one point, as if laying out illustrative details in only a few words weren't already the hallmark of a gifted communicator. The albums which follow, 2010's epic and the new Tramp, stretch muscles and viscera over those raw nerves. Even when she's conveying disappointment, hurt or longing, Van Etten sounds more assertive and complex these days, aided by the ever-knottier contributions of guest players from The National, Wye Oak, Beirut and The Walkmen. The feathery coos of "Much More Than That" have given way to a tensely argumentative and conflicted sneer in "Serpents," the remarkable first single from Tramp, out Feb. 7. When she sings, "I had a thought that you would take me seriously," her words are smeared with accusation instead of apologies. She says it herself in the song's chorus: "Everyone changes in time." By the time she gets to "All I Can" a few songs later, even her most defensive pronouncements — "I do all I can / We all make mistakes" — ring out with stormy grandiosity that sounds downright triumphant. To put it mildly, Van Etten wears those changes well. Evolving convincingly before the eyes of the world, she's now both a fearless balladeer and a blood-and-guts rocker, not to mention an increasingly vital and promising live performer. There's no artifice to Sharon Van Etten: With refreshing, unmistakable directness, she sings like a human being who wants more from herself.

There was the unlikely return of the ukulele, which took a starring role in one of the year's most fascinating and talked-about releases, the tUnE-yArDs album w h o k i l l. Wilco and Bright Eyes, each coming off a run of albums that divided fans, dropped career-defining records — no less odd or experimental than their predecessors, but packed top to bottom with hummable songs.

And Neutral Milk Hotel's Jeff Mangum, missing in action for more than a decade, reemerged with a sold-out solo tour and heaps of previously unreleased music. Bob Boilen, Robin Hilton, Stephen Thompson and Ann Powers take on these head-spinning moments and more — including their favorite songs, albums and discoveries of 2011 — in this year-end edition of All Songs Considered.

And out of a big paper bag he pulls a very chilled, huge bottle of vodka and says, 'Do you have glasses?'" Chuck Brown Song: "Bustin' Loose Stephen: "Not the first noisy artist to play the Tiny Desk, but still the biggest band ... The godfather of go-go music did not strip his sound down for the occasion whatsoever. And, because he's Chuck Brown, we indulged his every whim." Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros Song:  "Home" Stephen: "It's a very unusual-looking crop of very committed musicians, with this beautiful, communal vibe to them that really comes through."   The Avett Brothers Song: "Laundry Room"  Stephen: "Unbelievable volume, unbelievable power ... 'Laundry Room' is probably the individual song performance at a Tiny Desk Concert that I have listened to the most." Adele Song: "Someone Like You"  Bob: "I always love performers whose speaking voice is so different — such a disconnect from their singing voice." Stephen: "She also has this absolutely magnificent cackle. Right at the end of the set, she's like, 'Forgot to take my gloves off, hahahaha!' You just can't believe this incredibly delicate instrument is also tuned to that cackle. Marvelous, marvelous performance."   Tom Jones Song: "Green, Green Grass Of Home" Bob: "I imagined he would come with a backing track or something — I didn't know how he was going to do this. But this single guitar player, and Tom Jones' voice, was absolutely astonishing." Buke And Gass Song: "Medulla Oblongata" Bob: "A baritone ukulele and a guitar-bass hybrid. These are two old friends who have been making music for a long time — super-powerful, angular music." Phoenix Songs: "Lisztomania"  Stephen: "We have to turn off the air-conditioning units when the bands start to perform, because you get a low hum if you leave them on. And we have gigantic picture windows — sort of like ants under a magnifying glass, with no air conditioning and probably 150 people streaming in to see Phoenix, one of the biggest bands we've had play ... Just imagine the engines of NPR wheezing to a halt for about 10 minutes."   Wu Man Song:"White Snow in Spring" Bob: "Anyone who's into any kind of virtuosity in music should watch ... There's something going on that doesn't really look humanly possible." Rodrigo y Gabriela Song: "Hanuman" Stephen: "They played in metal bands, and somehow found a way to fuse it with flamenco music on nylon strings. That's one of those things where I feel like the target audience is anyone. You just have to love that." The Swell Season Song:"When Your Mind's Made Up" Bob: "There's that one moment in 'When Your Mind's Made Up,' where it builds to an explosive guitar moment ... and then it stops." Stephen: "And there's this buildup of nervous tension that then dissolves into laughter."";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 10 Aug 2011 13:30:50 -0400";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:9:"copyright";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"Copyright 2011 NPR - For Personal Use Only.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:91:"http://podcastdownload.npr.org/anon.npr-podcasts/podcast/510019/139394072/npr_139394072.mp3";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:9:"enclosure";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:127:"http://podcastdownload.npr.org/anon.npr-podcasts/podcast/510019/139394072/npr_139394072.mp3?orgId=1&e=139394072&ft=pod&f=510019";s:6:"length";s:1:"0";s:4:"type";s:10:"audio/mpeg";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:42:"http://www.itunes.com/dtds/podcast-1.0.dtd";a:4:{s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3:"NPR";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"summary";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3315:"After close to 150 performances captured on video, we figured it was time for a look back at one of NPR Music's most unpredictable creations: Tiny Desk Concerts.  On this episode of All Songs Considered, Bob and NPR Music editor Stephen Thompson share their stories of the most moving and surprising moments from three and a half years of live music in the NPR offices.  Gogol Bordello Song: "Start Wearing Purple" Bob: "I remember saying to the leader of the band, Eugene Hutz, 'Do you guys need something to drink?'

Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros Song:  "Home" Stephen: "It's a very unusual-looking crop of very committed musicians, with this beautiful, communal vibe to them that really comes through."   The Avett Brothers Song: "Laundry Room"  Stephen: "Unbelievable volume, unbelievable power ... 'Laundry Room' is probably the individual song performance at a Tiny Desk Concert that I have listened to the most." Adele Song: "Someone Like You"  Bob: "I always love performers whose speaking voice is so different — such a disconnect from their singing voice." Stephen: "She also has this absolutely magnificent cackle. Right at the end of the set, she's like, 'Forgot to take my gloves off, hahahaha!' You just can't believe this incredibly delicate instrument is also tuned to that cackle. Marvelous, marvelous performance."   Tom Jones Song: "Green, Green Grass Of Home" Bob: "I imagined he would come with a backing track or something — I didn't know how he was going to do this. But this single guitar player, and Tom Jones' voice, was absolutely astonishing." Buke And Gass Song: "Medulla Oblongata" Bob: "A baritone ukulele and a guitar-bass hybrid. These are two old friends who have been making music for a long time — super-powerful, angular music." Phoenix Songs: "Lisztomania"  Stephen: "We have to turn off the air-conditioning units when the bands start to perform, because you get a low hum if you leave them on. And we have gigantic picture windows — sort of like ants under a magnifying glass, with no air conditioning and probably 150 people streaming in to see Phoenix, one of the biggest bands we've had play ... Just imagine the engines of NPR wheezing to a halt for about 10 minutes."   Wu Man Song:"White Snow in Spring" Bob: "Anyone who's into any kind of virtuosity in music should watch ... There's something going on that doesn't really look humanly possible." Rodrigo y Gabriela Song: "Hanuman" Stephen: "They played in metal bands, and somehow found a way to fuse it with flamenco music on nylon strings. That's one of those things where I feel like the target audience is anyone. You just have to love that." The Swell Season Song:"When Your Mind's Made Up" Bob: "There's that one moment in 'When Your Mind's Made Up,' where it builds to an explosive guitar moment ... and then it stops."

In the years since, both events have continued to unite a diverse mix of artists from the far-reaching branches of both genres, while breaking new talent and showcasing revered veterans. That tradition continues July 30 and 31 2011, with the Newport Folk Festival, followed by the Newport Jazz Festival on Aug. 6 and 7. NPR Music will be at both events to webcast and broadcast a full slate of live concerts starting at noon ET each day.</p>
